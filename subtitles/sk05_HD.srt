1
00:00:05,530 --> 00:00:06,830
You don't know me?

2
00:00:07,330 --> 00:00:08,510
You really don't know?

3
00:00:08,890 --> 00:00:12,040
I remember, but there's no need to remember it again, is there?

4
00:00:12,170 --> 00:00:14,770
Is it okay for a girl to be running around stealing?

5
00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:16,190
He called me a girl!

6
00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:24,810
Didn't you see a tall guy?

7
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:26,430
I didn't see him.

8
00:00:26,930 --> 00:00:27,150
What!

9
00:00:27,590 --> 00:00:28,590
You disrespectful...

10
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:31,490
The guy who got hit, my sister beat him up.

11
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:32,290
Toe?

12
00:00:32,330 --> 00:00:35,290
It's been a long time, I'm so happy to see you.

13
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:35,930
Du-han!

14
00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:37,560
Ah, do you like coffee?

15
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:39,930
Do you like poetry?

16
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:41,450
Pardon?

17
00:00:41,830 --> 00:00:43,930
I thought I had to do something, anything.

18
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:45,390
Anything.

19
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:47,380
So, to the gisaeng house...

20
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:52,470
I'm sorry.

21
00:00:54,230 --> 00:00:55,510
Oh, right.

22
00:00:56,590 --> 00:00:58,440
What kind of work did you say you do?

23
00:00:59,870 --> 00:01:01,310
A small corner store.

24
00:01:01,370 --> 00:01:03,330
I was in a partnership with a friend...

25
00:01:03,370 --> 00:01:04,370
What do you sell?

26
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:09,620
We sell everything except for what we don't sell.

27
00:01:10,190 --> 00:01:11,190
Really?

28
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:15,450
Even back then, I never thought you'd be a beggar.

29
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:20,390
Honestly, I get angry when I see beggars.

30
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:25,590
They could live by their own sweat, but begging is worse than stealing.

31
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:30,650
It's just like stealing from someone's conscience with an invisible hand.

32
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:38,940
Thank you so much for today.

33
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:44,980
You're the first person to ever say that to me, Yeon-ji.

34
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:47,700
The Daegu rice mill?

35
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:50,220
Yes.

36
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:52,540
It was really strange back then.

37
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,320
We...

38
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:58,880
You see, people in our line of work don't say 'thank you' much.

39
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:01,240
It's just "How much did you make?"

40
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:02,460
"Let's split it."

41
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:03,900
"Did you eat breakfast?"

42
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:04,940
"I ate well."

43
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:07,700
We only say things like that, never 'thank you'.

44
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:08,990
Can I come see you again?

45
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:17,420
I'm not a lady from a noble family.

46
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:19,440
And this place...

47
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:21,020
I'm not a young master from a noble house either.

48
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:22,310
Can I come see you again?

49
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:30,200
It's pathetic to see you throwing away money you earned through hard work at a gisaeng house.

50
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,280
To meet me...

51
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,800
If you don't have money to throw around, let's meet outside.

52
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,100
Can I come see you again?

53
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:43,290
Can I come see you again?

54
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:48,980
Get home safely.

55
00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:31,050
Let's meet again.

56
00:03:55,210 --> 00:04:51,100
Did you close your eyes, afraid of losing me, like any other parting, to keep my reflection in your clear eyes forever? Oh fool, why didn't you know that when you left me, I hadn't even been able to show you all my love?

57
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:07,900
What did I tell you?

58
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:13,240
I told you this isn't a tiger's den, it's walking right into the tiger's mouth.

59
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:17,670
That Anchovy punk and Kim Du-han getting involved has made everything a dirty mess.

60
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:23,880
Just thinking about how much I got beaten by that girl makes my tongue feel like it's covered in thorns.

61
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:29,920
To these thugs, I must be the best medicine.

62
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:34,880
Even a saint has to be firm and teach those disobedient beggar punks a harsher lesson.

63
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:37,660
Let's grab a bowl of soup and go.

64
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:43,610
Welcome.

65
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:47,630
Miss, two bowls of soup please.

66
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:49,070
Yes.

67
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:57,520
I think my foot is broken.

68
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,400
It's not broken, just looks fractured.

69
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,140
It's definitely broken.

70
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,360
I can't walk.

71
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:06,460
But you walked all the way here.

72
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:10,080
I'm enduring it with willpower.

73
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:14,080
A guy like you couldn't even stand, but I'm different.

74
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:19,480
I told you not to glare at me with those damn dog eyes, it's bad luck.

75
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:22,380
Even if it's bad luck, I have to look at my nephew.

76
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:24,620
What?

77
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:27,780
What's wrong?

78
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:32,060
I'm going to show you what 'broken' really means, brother.

79
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:34,060
Are you crazy?

80
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:41,160
I'm not the crazy one. You're the one who drinks and fools around with girls all the time.

81
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:49,140
You haven't said a word yet, but we've already found out a lot about you.

82
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:51,740
Min-jae.

83
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:59,140
From the fact that you were a teacher at an elementary school to what books are on your bookshelf in your boarding room, we know it all.

84
00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:05,830
You'll talk eventually, so it's better for you to confess now.

85
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,400
You won't have much time to act so proud.

86
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:25,780
After a few more wounds, you won't be able to keep your mouth shut.

87
00:08:36,430 --> 00:08:38,650
Let me just say one thing.

88
00:08:41,530 --> 00:08:42,950
In your language.

89
00:08:55,370 --> 00:08:56,370
You bastard.

90
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:07,940
It's not a polite word, but you gave up on being a polite person a long time ago.

91
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:35,720
Damn it.

92
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:39,000
Why is only my foot freezing when I'm freezing all over?

93
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:51,250
I think he's dead.

94
00:09:52,010 --> 00:09:55,110
If you're going to die, die quickly. Don't make people suffer.

95
00:09:55,210 --> 00:09:57,090
Hey, bring me a handful of salt.

96
00:09:57,830 --> 00:09:58,350
Why?

97
00:09:58,390 --> 00:10:02,710
You have to sprinkle salt on a dead person's belly button so the ghost can't harm you.

98
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:03,970
Really?

99
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:11,260
Wow,

100
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:27,740
It's so white, isn't it?

101
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,040
Just a little bit.

102
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:30,080
It's a waste.

103
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:30,560
It's okay.

104
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:32,080
His belly button is so deep.

105
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:33,670
Wow, it all goes in, all of it.

106
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:38,060
Ah, you scared me.

107
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:39,260
Oh, you scared me to death.

108
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:40,980
Holding your breath like that.

109
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:42,070
You really scared me.

110
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:44,640
Stop making so much noise and get out.

111
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:46,480
Hey, Fly, aren't you going to work?

112
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:47,520
Yeah.

113
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,200
Who are you?

114
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:10,720
Getting shot and chased by Japanese patrolmen, you're either a robber or an independence fighter. Which one is it?

115
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:16,840
Are you mute?

116
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:18,190
Why aren't you answering?

117
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:20,480
Young master!

118
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:24,440
Have you come to your senses?

119
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,760
Don't you recognize me?

120
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:31,000
I'm Hongseong-daek's son, Bu-eongi.

121
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:34,980
No, I'm Man-seok.

122
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:36,720
Hey, Man-seok, what's wrong with you?

123
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:37,020
What do we do?

124
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:38,780
Do you recognize me now?

125
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,080
Young master, are you in a lot of pain?

126
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,120
Are you okay?

127
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:45,420
Stop calling me Young Master.

128
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:49,880
But if I don't call you Young Master, what should I call you, Young Master?

129
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:51,560
Just call me by my name.

130
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,060
How can I call you by your name?

131
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:54,540
You're not a dog or a pig.

132
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,160
I can't do that.

133
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,080
Then call me...

134
00:11:57,340 --> 00:11:57,720
Boss!

135
00:11:58,180 --> 00:11:58,680
Boss!

136
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:01,020
Boss, we have a problem.

137
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:03,760
The patrolmen have followed us here.

138
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:07,500
Hey, open up.

139
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:12,260
Damn it, you bastard.

140
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,080
Hey,

141
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:26,420
We don't need to all take the fall for this guy.

142
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:27,660
What are you talking about?

143
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:30,860
Boss, you're not thinking of handing over our young master, are you?

144
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:34,300
If you hand our young master over to those Japanese dogs, he'll die.

145
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:36,160
If he dies, he dies. What's the big deal?

146
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,860
He's lived well so far, what more could he want?

147
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:39,200
Fate is in heaven's hands.

148
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:41,760
How can you just throw away a precious life like that?

149
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:42,400
Oh, you bastard.

150
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:43,740
We're all going to die.

151
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:45,380
There's no need to make a scene.

152
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,780
I hate causing trouble for others.

153
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,230
Hey, do you really have to do this?

154
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:55,030
Hey, Parrot, let's draw lots.

155
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:57,570
One for you, one for me, and wake up Raccoon.

156
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:01,150
Hey, is there any rotten bean paste left?

157
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:08,370
Kuroki-gun.

158
00:13:08,610 --> 00:13:08,790
Yes.

159
00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:11,430
This doesn't seem to be a beggar's shack.

160
00:13:11,470 --> 00:13:11,610
No.

161
00:13:11,970 --> 00:13:14,570
This is a dye factory. The shack is at the very end.

162
00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:16,550
Lead the way.

163
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:17,870
Yes.

164
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:26,970
No, what's going on?

165
00:13:27,530 --> 00:13:27,930
Move.

166
00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:29,320
No, what's happening?

167
00:13:29,650 --> 00:13:30,870
Beggars don't need to know.

168
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:34,550
Hey, you have to explain what's going on so we can help or not.

169
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:38,890
The suspect in the assassination attempt on Superintendent Endo in Jongno has appeared in front of Gukilguan.

170
00:13:38,930 --> 00:13:39,930
Right, Gukilguan.

171
00:13:40,730 --> 00:13:43,630
If it's Gukilguan, it's just a stone's throw from Supyodong Bridge.

172
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:46,510
Then wouldn't anyone, not just a beggar, flee under Supyogyo Bridge?

173
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:49,200
How dare they come all the way to Yeomcheon Bridge...

174
00:13:57,130 --> 00:14:00,630
A patrolman of the Great Japanese Empire is giving an order to a Joseon beggar.

175
00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:02,970
How dare you run your mouth and talk back?

176
00:14:04,550 --> 00:14:05,550
Kuroki-gun.

177
00:14:05,610 --> 00:14:05,770
Yes.

178
00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:07,710
Let's go into the shack.

179
00:14:07,810 --> 00:14:08,810
Yes.

180
00:14:10,430 --> 00:14:13,430
There's someone with a skin disease in there, so be careful.

181
00:14:14,310 --> 00:14:19,050
We're so dirty it's fine for us, but they say it's easily spread to ordinary people.

182
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:23,180
You.

183
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:25,740
Lead the way.

184
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:41,600
What is that guy?

185
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:46,140
That's Gimbap.

186
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:48,260
All the trash in the Donggwanpyeong area is his responsibility.

187
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:49,300
Who asked you that?

188
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:50,600
Why is he like that?

189
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:53,640
I told you.

190
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,080
Skin disease.

191
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:57,840
Kuroki-gun.

192
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,240
Yes.

193
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:06,640
Hey!

194
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:11,300
Hey, get up!

195
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:13,540
Hey, friend.

196
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:24,220
Hey, even if you're a beggar, if you bathe properly once or twice a year like me, you won't end up in this state.

197
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:27,030
When did you ever bathe twice a year, you punk?

198
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:31,090
You bathed with me last Chuseok, when have you seen water since then?

199
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:32,320
You lying bastard.

200
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:35,840
Filthy bastards.

201
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:05,620
Damn it.

202
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:07,490
I'll wipe it for you.

203
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:10,320
The smell of rotten bean paste is no joke...

204
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:11,360
It's okay.

205
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:14,640
By the way, what's Gimbap?

206
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:23,700
Damn it, last year in the back alleys of Honmachi, there was a guy who would beat up drunk Gyeongseong University students and steal everything from their hats to their socks, pretending to be a mute beggar.

207
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:26,820
Did he get beaten up by the Boss and come down to Busan saying he was going back home?

208
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:28,260
He looks just like you, man.

209
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:31,960
Anyway, our Boss's mind works incredibly fast.

210
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,550
How did he think of smearing bean paste and using a mute beggar's name?

211
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:36,900
Right, Young Master?

212
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:39,390
I told you to stop calling me Young Master.

213
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:41,900
Just call me Gimbap.

214
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:46,380
Since I'm in the world of beggars, it's better to be called by a beggar's name.

215
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:48,260
Then if not Young Master, should I call you Mr. Gimbap...

216
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:49,550
What's with "Mr. Gimbap"?

217
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:50,740
It's just Gimbap.

218
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:53,960
Hey, Parrot.

219
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:57,260
Get Gimbap a begging gourd too.

220
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:00,900
Just giving him a begging gourd doesn't make him a beggar.

221
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:03,860
You know I don't turn away guests who come to my house.

222
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:05,720
But he didn't come to beg.

223
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:08,180
If we're not careful, the one who holds our family's lives in his hands...

224
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:09,220
Parrot.

225
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:12,980
Don't you have any spare begging gourds?

226
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:22,860
Boss, Boss.

227
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:24,900
The police are here again.

228
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:26,540
Move.

229
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:30,420
Hey, you, come out.

230
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:34,520
Hey, you punk, what are you looking at?

231
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:36,520
Come out.

232
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:37,920
Move, you bastard.

233
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,060
Boss, where are you going?

234
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:44,100
Boss.

235
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:49,020
Boss.

236
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:51,760
Boss.

237
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:56,400
Do you know how to smoke?

238
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:14,300
I heard you're a pretty smart beggar.

239
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:15,500
Who said that?

240
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:17,280
Am I some kind of owl?

241
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:18,120
Why would my head spin well?

242
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:22,060
You guys must go everywhere, digging through trash.

243
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:24,040
I go wherever I can set my feet.

244
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:25,260
I see.

245
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:29,840
I want to buy your eyes and feet.

246
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:35,180
There are 400,000 citizens in Gyeongseong.

247
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:42,140
In a wartime system, we can't let unruly elements run loose, but with our current manpower, we can't maintain perfect underground control.

248
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:49,260
We know everything, even when your back door falls off its hinges. So you want help from smelly beggars?

249
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:55,800
We're having trouble identifying the terrorists who have been assassinating government officials lately.

250
00:18:57,940 --> 00:19:04,190
Even trash like you, when you think about it, are citizens of the empire who live under the grace of His Majesty the Emperor.

251
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:08,300
So?

252
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:13,320
When you're digging through trash and you find someone suspicious,

253
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:17,120
report it immediately.

254
00:19:20,390 --> 00:19:25,270
If we catch the person the detective is looking for, what do we beggars get?

255
00:19:26,330 --> 00:19:30,470
That guy is so important, his value can't be measured in money.

256
00:19:32,410 --> 00:19:34,110
I'll give you whatever you want.

257
00:19:35,210 --> 00:19:39,450
If you want money, I'll give you money. If you want land, I can give you land.

258
00:19:41,030 --> 00:19:42,470
Remember this well.

259
00:19:44,170 --> 00:19:47,450
He has a gunshot wound on his left arm and is on the tall side.

260
00:19:48,850 --> 00:19:53,770
The woman who was caught with him is a real pain. No matter how much we beat her, she won't talk.

261
00:19:55,330 --> 00:19:58,970
For now, I'm counting on you.

262
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:08,120
Abe-sa!

263
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:09,820
Abe-sa!

264
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:11,280
Seong-min says he'll talk.

265
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:13,380
He's going to talk about the accomplice?

266
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:13,760
Yes.

267
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:16,470
He said he'll write down everything he knows.

268
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:19,120
No matter how tough she pretends to be, she's still a woman.

269
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:20,960
She's a really difficult woman.

270
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:22,960
Man, that was tough.

271
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:28,620
When she said she'd confess, I gave her a brush, and she asked for a good pen that writes well.

272
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:30,110
So I gave her a fountain pen.

273
00:20:34,730 --> 00:20:36,450
You foolish woman.

274
00:20:38,430 --> 00:20:39,150
Let me go!

275
00:20:39,190 --> 00:20:50,590
In the last moments of my life, I spit three curses on Japan.

276
00:20:53,570 --> 00:20:56,910
The first is the Yasukuni Shrine.

277
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:03,990
The second is your national flag, the Hinomaru.

278
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:14,170
The third is the head of your dog leader, Emperor Hirohito.

279
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:51,940
Hey, Raccoon.

280
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:54,200
I'm taking food to the kids.

281
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:57,440
I don't know if their stomachs have gotten bigger, but they eat a lot.

282
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:58,480
Is it not enough?

283
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:00,280
No, that should be enough.

284
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,160
You kids, don't fight.

285
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:06,580
Hey, Crow.

286
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:09,060
Bring some food for Gimbap, too.

287
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:16,660
Hey, Young Master.

288
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:17,980
Get it yourself next time.

289
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:18,760
Am I your servant?

290
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:21,020
Why do I have to bring it to you every time?

291
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:21,740
Me too.

292
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:23,400
You eat too.

293
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:26,320
What are you looking at?

294
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,400
I told you to eat.

295
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:32,800
If you want more, just say so.

296
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:43,260
What's wrong?

297
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:47,280
Who is it?

298
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:48,620
The Boss went out today.

299
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:51,090
What are you talking about?

300
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:53,560
You can't fool a ghost.

301
00:22:54,740 --> 00:23:02,840
Ever since we were rolling around in front of the tiny Daegu station, I've been able to tell if the Boss needs to piss or take a dump just by looking at his face.

302
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:07,440
He's like a police dog, man.

303
00:23:17,620 --> 00:23:18,360
Gimbap?

304
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,900
That Gimbap guy.

305
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:23,550
If we bring him here, our family will be in danger too.

306
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:27,760
I'll take care of it.

307
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:33,470
I'm just saying this because I'm worried they'll sniff him out.

308
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:36,460
Once those dogs get a scent, they'll...

309
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:37,500
Hey.

310
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:40,680
I made the decision.

311
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:44,520
Alright.

312
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:49,110
Boss uncle, you know about the party tomorrow, right?

313
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:49,400
Huh?

314
00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:50,660
What?

315
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:57,100
It's the day the city's four main gates open. They said they're holding a ritual and want us to have a good time.

316
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:55,540
In January, the night sky is adorned with brilliant stars. Holding a zither, the Jinju gisaeng Nongae throws herself into the Namgang River, embracing her enemy. In March, a pair of swallows flies in on the third day. Holding a zither, another month passes. On a busy road, lunch is skipped. Enjoying a drink, Guan Yu of the Three Kingdoms appears.

317
00:25:13,990 --> 00:25:14,870
You go first.

318
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:16,870
I'll watch a little longer and come.

319
00:25:17,150 --> 00:25:20,810
The six generals, Han Jeong-jin, applaud...

320
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:26,780
Hey, friends, let's have some fun, friends...

321
00:25:47,330 --> 00:25:48,370
Is everything alright?

322
00:25:48,410 --> 00:25:49,410
Yes, yes.

323
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:50,850
Can I see the ledger?

324
00:25:51,430 --> 00:25:51,830
Yes, yes.

325
00:25:51,890 --> 00:25:52,590
Here you go.

326
00:25:52,650 --> 00:25:53,650
Here you go.

327
00:25:54,470 --> 00:26:01,530
Oh, I was wondering where that fishy smell was coming from. A quail chick is sitting next to an old eagle.

328
00:26:02,690 --> 00:26:06,190
Hey, I haven't seen you around before. Come here.

329
00:26:08,770 --> 00:26:10,310
Just stay seated.

330
00:26:12,930 --> 00:26:17,190
Which bitch started selling her face in Jongno without reporting to Double-Blade?

331
00:26:17,690 --> 00:26:18,940
Do you not know who I am?

332
00:26:20,050 --> 00:26:22,030
It smells rotten in here.

333
00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:24,930
Open the door.

334
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:26,440
What?

335
00:26:28,690 --> 00:26:32,530
Are only the Japanese customers, and you look down on Joseon people?

336
00:26:33,990 --> 00:26:43,310
I've never discriminated between Japanese and Korean customers, and I plan to keep it that way. I'm talking about people, not mice.

337
00:26:43,450 --> 00:26:44,450
Not a mouse.

338
00:26:44,890 --> 00:26:47,270
How dare you talk like that in front of me?

339
00:26:47,770 --> 00:26:48,290
Look!

340
00:26:48,330 --> 00:26:50,410
You better watch out for mouse holes.

341
00:26:51,030 --> 00:26:53,050
Don't let your stocks fall again here.

342
00:26:53,430 --> 00:26:54,550
Are you in front of me?

343
00:26:54,590 --> 00:26:55,590
Hey!

344
00:26:55,890 --> 00:26:56,890
You punk!

345
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,040
You must be very angry.

346
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:19,940
You said you get angry when you see beggars because guys like me are bad people who live by stealing other people's conscience.

347
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:31,380
I'm sorry.

348
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:32,520
For lying.

349
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:34,820
Business?

350
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:37,420
I'm in the beggar business.

351
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:39,520
Actually, I'm really...

352
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:44,460
You don't have to say you won't meet me again.

353
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:45,600
I know that much.

354
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:51,420
Even if I'm a beggar, I won't come looking for you in a pathetic way.

355
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:53,340
I'm sorry.

356
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:54,450
For making you angry.

357
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:55,680
Yes.

358
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:57,600
I'm angry right now.

359
00:27:58,940 --> 00:28:00,240
I've always hated beggars.

360
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:07,280
When I see beggars who beg even though they can earn a living on their own, I get so angry I want to hit them.

361
00:28:10,350 --> 00:28:14,270
And what makes me even angrier is myself.

362
00:28:18,970 --> 00:28:24,410
Even though I know what kind of person you are, I can't bring myself to think that I shouldn't meet you.

363
00:28:24,570 --> 00:28:25,570
I...

364
00:28:32,030 --> 00:28:35,530
Because of money, I gave up the thing I wanted most in the world.

365
00:28:37,850 --> 00:28:39,710
But what I need is money.

366
00:28:39,770 --> 00:28:41,270
Not a man with a lot of money.

367
00:28:46,490 --> 00:28:47,490
What did you say?

368
00:28:49,350 --> 00:28:51,950
Can you please say what you just said one more time?

369
00:28:52,830 --> 00:28:53,830
No.

370
00:28:54,350 --> 00:28:56,110
I don't remember what I said.

371
00:28:59,490 --> 00:29:01,070
Can I visit you again?

372
00:29:02,470 --> 00:29:03,470
Pardon?

373
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:36,820
What kind of book are you looking for?

374
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:38,900
Uh.

375
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:40,280
Not a book.

376
00:29:41,660 --> 00:29:42,760
I came to buy a poem.

377
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:43,800
Huh?

378
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:46,680
A poem?

379
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:49,740
Yes.

380
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:50,780
That...

381
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:52,250
That strange person's poem?

382
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:53,940
How much is one of those?

383
00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:54,760
University! University!

384
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:55,260
University!

385
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:56,080
Let's go!

386
00:29:56,260 --> 00:29:56,600
Let's go!

387
00:29:57,180 --> 00:29:58,180
Alright!

388
00:29:58,760 --> 00:29:59,360
Let's go!

389
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:00,120
Where?

390
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:00,520
Over there!

391
00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:00,740
Over there!

392
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:01,920
Let's go!

393
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:03,080
Get in, quick!

394
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:07,820
Rock paper scissors!

395
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:08,200
Hurry!

396
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:08,360
Hurry!

397
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:10,040
Rock paper scissors!

398
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:10,740
Rock paper scissors!

399
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:11,100
Scissors!

400
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:12,720
Rock paper scissors!

401
00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:13,000
Scissors!

402
00:30:13,340 --> 00:30:14,340
I won!

403
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:15,640
How's the tea?

404
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:19,260
I'm much better.

405
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:20,520
Thank you.

406
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:21,080
Thanks to you.

407
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:22,320
What's this?

408
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:22,720
Huh?

409
00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:24,260
What's that note?

410
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:26,680
No, this is...

411
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:27,440
It's a poem.

412
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:28,460
A Hungarian poem...

413
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:29,120
A poem?

414
00:30:29,540 --> 00:30:30,200
Yes.

415
00:30:30,380 --> 00:30:30,640
A poem.

416
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:32,260
Ah... a poem.

417
00:30:34,050 --> 00:30:35,420
Then you must know Yi Sang.

418
00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:37,060
Pardon?

419
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:38,120
Yi Sang.

420
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:40,900
He... he died in Tokyo a while ago, right?

421
00:30:41,660 --> 00:30:42,720
I know Yi Sang.

422
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:43,820
But...

423
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:46,320
How do you know Yi Sang?

424
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:47,720
From lying.

425
00:30:47,780 --> 00:30:48,780
Hey, you mute.

426
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:54,420
Even if I look like this, I've even been to the tea house that Yi Sang used to run and had coffee.

427
00:30:54,580 --> 00:30:55,180
I'm sorry.

428
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:56,900
That's not what I meant...

429
00:30:56,940 --> 00:30:57,940
Hey.

430
00:30:58,840 --> 00:30:59,840
See?

431
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:01,880
This is Yi Sang's poetry collection.

432
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:03,160
Yes, but...

433
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:04,900
Are all educated people like that?

434
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:07,680
Hey, what are you looking down on me for living under a bridge?

435
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:09,000
No, that's not it...

436
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:11,960
I was just surprised that the Boss was reading a poetry book...

437
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,080
I'm not reading it, I'm giving it to someone.

438
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:15,120
Really?

439
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:19,440
If you're giving a poetry book as a gift, it must be for a woman.

440
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:21,160
Yes, I'm giving it as a gift.

441
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:25,760
I received this from a woman, too.

442
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:28,120
Hey, try reading this.

443
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:33,980
This might be a bit difficult...

444
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:40,280
"Crow's Eye View."

445
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:45,880
Thirteen children are running down the road, and the road is a dead end.

446
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:48,760
The first child says he's scared.

447
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:51,440
The second child also says he's scared.

448
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:54,140
The third child also says he's scared.

449
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:57,000
The fourth child also says he's scared.

450
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:59,740
The fifth child also says he's scared.

451
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:03,120
The sixth child also says he's scared.

452
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:05,530
Are you reading it correctly?

453
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:07,560
Yes.

454
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:09,020
Should I keep reading?

455
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:09,840
That's enough.

456
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:12,360
Anyway, try reading your note.

457
00:32:16,050 --> 00:32:17,050
Liberty, my love.

458
00:32:17,130 --> 00:32:19,370
For you, I would give my life.

459
00:32:20,290 --> 00:32:21,530
But, my love.

460
00:32:22,510 --> 00:32:24,830
For liberty, I would give even you.

461
00:32:26,010 --> 00:32:27,010
Liberty?

462
00:32:28,070 --> 00:32:29,610
Yes, liberty.

463
00:32:30,310 --> 00:32:31,310
I know about that.

464
00:32:31,990 --> 00:32:33,990
It means doing whatever you want, right?

465
00:32:34,370 --> 00:32:36,210
But to give your life for that?

466
00:32:38,290 --> 00:32:40,290
It means freedom from oppression and bondage.

467
00:32:40,330 --> 00:32:43,290
Something we've lost for over 30 years.

468
00:32:44,710 --> 00:32:48,850
A country where you can live according to your own thoughts without interference from others...

469
00:32:48,890 --> 00:32:49,890
What about here?

470
00:32:50,190 --> 00:32:51,190
Pardon?

471
00:32:51,390 --> 00:32:52,690
Here, at Yeomcheon Bridge.

472
00:32:53,750 --> 00:32:57,010
No one asks what kind of dog bone you were in the past.

473
00:32:57,610 --> 00:32:59,850
They don't care, and they don't ask.

474
00:33:00,930 --> 00:33:03,280
It's your freedom to come and go as you please.

475
00:33:03,590 --> 00:33:05,990
You don't take from others, and you don't steal.

476
00:33:06,370 --> 00:33:08,610
There's nothing to take, and nothing to hide.

477
00:33:08,650 --> 00:33:12,470
If you have something, you share it. If you have your own, you can have it.

478
00:33:12,670 --> 00:33:13,570
Well, that's true, but...

479
00:33:13,610 --> 00:33:15,610
You're on the run right now, aren't you?

480
00:33:17,970 --> 00:33:20,030
No one comes looking for you here.

481
00:33:21,670 --> 00:33:23,230
No one even stops by.

482
00:33:25,510 --> 00:33:31,910
Even though it's a dark shack where the sun doesn't shine, you can live freely as you please.

483
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:41,500
You can rest here as long as you want, as comfortably as you want, and no one will interfere.

484
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:47,240
Where else can you find this kind of freedom right now?

485
00:33:55,010 --> 00:33:56,010
Boss!

486
00:33:56,090 --> 00:33:56,690
There's trouble.

487
00:33:56,770 --> 00:33:58,330
I think you need to go to the store right away.

488
00:33:58,370 --> 00:33:58,890
Hurry, hurry.

489
00:33:58,990 --> 00:34:00,390
Hey, move aside, ladies!

490
00:34:05,180 --> 00:34:05,780
Hey, what's this?

491
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:06,900
Who did this...

492
00:34:08,220 --> 00:34:08,740
Double-Blade.

493
00:34:09,140 --> 00:34:10,690
Why would Double-Blade do this?

494
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:15,500
Other stores are already paying 30 won, but they were making a fuss because we were only paying 20 won...

495
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:17,040
Did Double-Blade come himself?

496
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:21,400
Double-Blade just stood outside for a moment, and his underlings came in and smashed everything!

497
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:22,840
Does Du-han know about this?

498
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:24,100
I don't know.

499
00:34:24,340 --> 00:34:25,340
Bring the ledger!

500
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:29,340
20 bottles of beauty water, 15 jeon each, 3 won.

501
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:31,420
What are you going to do, open it?

502
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:34,080
If you want to get compensation, you have to know how much was damaged.

503
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:34,640
Are you crazy?

504
00:34:34,860 --> 00:34:36,260
You're going to get money from Double-Blade?

505
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:37,900
How many tubs of cream are left?

506
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:39,040
S-six.

507
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:39,900
Hey, Hyeongdo.

508
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:41,840
How are you going to get money from Double-Blade?

509
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:44,580
I'm going to go to Double-Blade right now with Du-han.

510
00:34:44,620 --> 00:34:47,060
Double-Blade knows you're Du-han's friend.

511
00:34:47,860 --> 00:34:49,340
The total is 120 won.

512
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:51,980
Hey, sir, really.

513
00:34:52,700 --> 00:34:55,640
If something like this happened, you should have told me first.

514
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:58,080
Why did this have to happen while I was in Mapo?

515
00:34:58,420 --> 00:35:00,820
Are you going to keep pretending you don't know?

516
00:35:01,660 --> 00:35:03,010
What are you talking about?

517
00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:05,120
You don't know what you are right now?

518
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:07,500
Is your fist a rock, or is your head a rock?

519
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:08,800
What?

520
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:11,040
Since I received the grand prize!

521
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:11,320
What misunderstanding!

522
00:35:11,740 --> 00:35:13,440
Have I been putting up with you all this time?

523
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:14,380
Don't talk recklessly!

524
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:15,000
What do you mean, recklessly?

525
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:16,040
I told you not to be reckless!

526
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:16,520
Sit down!

527
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:17,100
Sit down!

528
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:18,360
Sit down!

529
00:35:29,220 --> 00:35:33,380
Double-Blade messed up your shop to show off to you, Du-han.

530
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:35,140
Double-Blade isn't a fool.

531
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:38,410
He knows a tiger can't stay under a wolf forever.

532
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:39,830
What are you talking about?

533
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:44,520
The merchants at the night market want you to take over the patrol, not the increasingly brutal Double-Blade.

534
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:45,560
You know that too.

535
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:46,940
I can't do that!

536
00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:48,660
He's my senior, how can I...

537
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:49,700
Hey, you idiot.

538
00:35:49,820 --> 00:35:51,740
You think Double-Blade sees you that naively?

539
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:52,880
Stop with the nonsense!

540
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:54,320
My boss would never do that!

541
00:35:58,060 --> 00:35:59,140
Hey, Du-han!

542
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:00,560
Hey, Du-han!

543
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:02,360
Hey, Du-han!

544
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:11,760
It's foolish to swing your fist when you shouldn't.

545
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:17,880
But it's even more foolish not to use your fist when you absolutely have to.

546
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:21,910
I'll take care of your business myself.

547
00:36:26,780 --> 00:36:27,780
What is it?

548
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:30,420
What's going on now?

549
00:36:34,430 --> 00:36:39,910
I'm seeing you for the first time, but I've heard your name so much it's made my ears bleed.

550
00:36:41,330 --> 00:36:48,570
Ever since I was a kid, I thought Double-Blade was the greatest man after Admiral Yi Sun-sin.

551
00:36:49,470 --> 00:36:52,470
I've respected you for a long time.

552
00:36:53,550 --> 00:36:55,100
Weren't you in Daegu back then?

553
00:36:57,190 --> 00:36:58,490
No, that...

554
00:36:58,530 --> 00:37:02,430
Even if I was in Daegu, your name is famous, sir.

555
00:37:03,270 --> 00:37:06,430
Is there anywhere in the country I haven't been?

556
00:37:08,330 --> 00:37:13,410
I have nothing to say but to ask for your guidance, sir.

557
00:37:14,450 --> 00:37:18,690
If a person like you just gives the word, I'll do anything...

558
00:37:18,730 --> 00:37:19,730
Hey, you punk!

559
00:37:20,130 --> 00:37:21,990
Why are you being so subservient?

560
00:37:23,290 --> 00:37:24,850
No, it's just...

561
00:37:24,890 --> 00:37:26,250
It's not subservience.

562
00:37:27,030 --> 00:37:33,410
I was just trying to get your permission to manage the beggars who crawl around Jongno.

563
00:37:33,790 --> 00:37:36,240
Hey, hey, you can do whatever you want with that.

564
00:37:36,710 --> 00:37:38,860
Those beggar punks are none of my business.

565
00:37:39,850 --> 00:37:41,500
Hey, I'll give you salt for that.

566
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:18,340
Give me that book that the kids are scared of.

567
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:21,380
No, are you going to go like this?

568
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:27,160
Women value what they can see.

569
00:38:27,660 --> 00:38:30,560
Of course, a smart woman wouldn't think that's everything.

570
00:38:31,660 --> 00:38:35,340
Still, unless you're blind, it's better to be dressed cleanly.

571
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:44,180
Hey, Crow!

572
00:38:44,980 --> 00:38:45,980
Crow!

573
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:49,880
Why, why, Boss?

574
00:38:51,660 --> 00:38:52,160
What?

575
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:53,580
What's wrong?

576
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:56,140
Oh, what's wrong?

577
00:38:56,580 --> 00:38:59,020
Hey, did you return the overcoat you stole last time?

578
00:38:59,060 --> 00:38:59,380
Of course.

579
00:38:59,620 --> 00:38:59,940
Really?

580
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:00,320
Yeah.

581
00:39:00,540 --> 00:39:00,800
Where is it?

582
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:01,920
It's gone.

583
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:04,120
Hey, tell me the truth. I won't get mad.

584
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:04,660
It's true.

585
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:05,280
Really?

586
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:07,020
Yeah, you know I can't lie.

587
00:39:07,060 --> 00:39:08,900
Hey, just wear it once today and give it back.

588
00:39:08,940 --> 00:39:09,660
I told you I returned it!

589
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:10,900
Who's going to wear it?

590
00:39:10,940 --> 00:39:11,940
Me.

591
00:39:15,140 --> 00:39:16,590
The Boss is going to wear it?

592
00:39:16,740 --> 00:39:17,740
Yeah.

593
00:39:18,260 --> 00:39:19,260
Really?

594
00:39:19,580 --> 00:39:21,530
Hey, I only need to wear it once today.

595
00:39:22,220 --> 00:39:23,220
Hey, Fly!

596
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:25,080
Bring the overcoat!

597
00:39:29,890 --> 00:39:32,370
They really don't pay their debts.

598
00:39:32,750 --> 00:39:33,750
These bastards.

599
00:39:35,910 --> 00:39:38,090
Two, three, four, five.

600
00:39:39,830 --> 00:39:40,830
There's no answer.

601
00:39:42,090 --> 00:39:43,250
Oh, President Im.

602
00:39:43,330 --> 00:39:44,330
Is business good?

603
00:39:44,390 --> 00:39:45,390
You're here?

604
00:39:48,740 --> 00:39:51,180
Hey, is this the thing the king gave to his favorite lover?

605
00:39:51,220 --> 00:39:52,720
King Sejong.

606
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:54,490
How much is one of these?

607
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:55,800
50 jeon.

608
00:39:56,220 --> 00:39:56,940
Hey, let me have it on credit.

609
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:58,680
I'll pay you back tenfold later.

610
00:39:59,340 --> 00:40:00,760
You're going to pay me back 5 won?

611
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:01,920
In ten years.

612
00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:04,400
You're a real thick-skinned bastard.

613
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:06,640
Then lend me 150,000 won while you're at it.

614
00:40:13,730 --> 00:40:14,850
You eat it.

615
00:40:16,390 --> 00:40:17,490
You can't just eat it.

616
00:40:17,910 --> 00:40:19,890
You have to peel it first.

617
00:40:22,830 --> 00:40:27,470
A long time ago, King Sejong gave this to his favorite woman as a gift.

618
00:40:29,350 --> 00:40:31,870
Today, that bitter and delicious soup...

619
00:40:32,730 --> 00:40:33,910
I'll buy it for you.

620
00:40:35,510 --> 00:40:36,510
Coffee?

621
00:40:37,690 --> 00:40:39,270
Yes, coffee.

622
00:40:59,610 --> 00:41:00,830
That looks good on you.

623
00:41:02,510 --> 00:41:03,510
It's an old coat.

624
00:41:03,770 --> 00:41:04,930
So what if it's old?

625
00:41:05,290 --> 00:41:06,650
Sometimes old is better.

626
00:41:08,350 --> 00:41:10,100
I used to like everything new, too.

627
00:41:11,590 --> 00:41:14,170
Books, notebooks, and bags.

628
00:41:15,010 --> 00:41:17,310
I even preferred hanging out with new friends.

629
00:41:18,090 --> 00:41:20,990
I found anything old to be a bit boring and uninteresting.

630
00:41:21,510 --> 00:41:23,330
But now it's different.

631
00:41:23,750 --> 00:41:26,890
As time goes by, everything gets a little old, doesn't it?

632
00:41:27,010 --> 00:41:28,010
Right?

633
00:41:28,690 --> 00:41:29,690
Yes.

634
00:41:30,210 --> 00:41:33,670
Now I prefer things that are a little old rather than new.

635
00:41:34,710 --> 00:41:37,210
There's no sense of loss when something new fades.

636
00:41:38,650 --> 00:41:39,890
Old things are much more comfortable, right?

637
00:41:39,930 --> 00:41:41,280
They feel more comfortable.

638
00:41:43,150 --> 00:41:43,710
Let's go.

639
00:41:43,970 --> 00:41:46,770
Let's go eat something more delicious than coffee today.

640
00:42:33,630 --> 00:42:35,290
What's this?

641
00:42:35,730 --> 00:42:36,670
This...

642
00:42:36,710 --> 00:42:39,870
Yi Sang's "Crow's Eye View"...

643
00:42:39,910 --> 00:42:40,910
is in here.

644
00:42:41,150 --> 00:42:42,810
Are you giving this to me?

645
00:42:42,890 --> 00:42:43,890
A gift?

646
00:42:44,250 --> 00:42:44,510
Yes.

647
00:42:44,890 --> 00:42:45,890
A gift.

648
00:42:46,150 --> 00:42:47,150
Thank you.

649
00:42:47,730 --> 00:42:49,380
Oh, you like poetry too, Chunsam.

650
00:42:49,730 --> 00:42:49,990
No.

651
00:42:50,030 --> 00:42:51,030
Not really.

652
00:42:52,210 --> 00:42:55,970
Uh... "Crow's Eye View" is supposed to be a picture drawn by a crow...

653
00:42:56,010 --> 00:42:56,330
That's right.

654
00:42:57,010 --> 00:42:58,630
A bird's-eye view seen by a crow from the sky.

655
00:42:58,670 --> 00:42:59,770
It's unique, isn't it?

656
00:42:59,830 --> 00:43:02,030
But why a crow of all things? It's bad luck.

657
00:43:02,650 --> 00:43:04,070
Do you like crows, Yeon-ji?

658
00:43:04,610 --> 00:43:05,610
No.

659
00:43:05,850 --> 00:43:07,970
The one I like is the poem "Mirror"...

660
00:43:08,010 --> 00:43:09,260
You know "Mirror," right?

661
00:43:10,010 --> 00:43:10,170
Yes.

662
00:43:10,250 --> 00:43:10,690
I know.

663
00:43:11,030 --> 00:43:11,410
"Mirror."

664
00:43:11,850 --> 00:43:14,700
I still don't get it, no matter how many times I read it.

665
00:43:14,950 --> 00:43:17,370
But this one seems like it will give me an even bigger headache.

666
00:43:17,410 --> 00:43:17,690
Right?

667
00:43:17,990 --> 00:43:19,290
You think so too, Yeon-ji?

668
00:43:20,070 --> 00:43:22,030
All of Mr. Yi Sang's poems are like that.

669
00:43:22,070 --> 00:43:23,070
Me too.

670
00:43:26,190 --> 00:43:27,190
I'd rather...

671
00:43:28,070 --> 00:43:30,320
a nightingale or a cuckoo would be better.

672
00:43:33,350 --> 00:43:33,510
Pardon?

673
00:43:33,990 --> 00:43:34,290
A cuckoo?

674
00:43:34,330 --> 00:43:35,570
Yes.

675
00:43:35,950 --> 00:43:36,430
A cuckoo.

676
00:43:36,810 --> 00:43:39,790
Cuckoos are much cuter, their songs are nice...

677
00:43:39,830 --> 00:43:41,010
You know the cuckoo, right?

678
00:43:41,050 --> 00:43:41,570
Cuckoo.

679
00:43:41,610 --> 00:43:42,610
Cuckoo.

680
00:43:42,970 --> 00:43:44,010
Yes.

681
00:43:45,490 --> 00:43:46,490
Cuckoo...

682
00:43:46,530 --> 00:43:47,090
You know, right?

683
00:43:47,170 --> 00:43:47,483
Right?

684
00:43:47,930 --> 00:43:48,250
Cuckoo.

685
00:43:48,730 --> 00:43:49,770
Cuckoo...

686
00:43:50,430 --> 00:43:51,850
But...

687
00:43:51,890 --> 00:43:52,750
It's bad luck.

688
00:43:52,890 --> 00:43:53,430
Crows are.

689
00:43:53,530 --> 00:43:55,810
They're dirty, filthy, and noisy...

690
00:43:55,850 --> 00:43:56,970
But the crow in "Crow's Eye View"...

691
00:43:57,010 --> 00:43:58,010
My mom...

692
00:44:00,170 --> 00:44:04,030
In my hometown, people hate crows.

693
00:44:04,330 --> 00:44:05,430
Yes.

694
00:44:17,500 --> 00:44:18,640
A magpie...

695
00:44:18,680 --> 00:44:20,840
might be different, you know?

696
00:44:38,290 --> 00:44:39,770
Hello, sir.

697
00:44:40,470 --> 00:44:41,470
What?

698
00:44:43,990 --> 00:44:45,070
I'm Lee Jung-jae.

699
00:44:45,790 --> 00:44:46,790
Lee Jung-jae?

700
00:44:47,230 --> 00:44:48,230
Do you remember me?

701
00:44:49,250 --> 00:44:51,750
I bought the champion bull at the wrestling match when I was young.

702
00:44:51,790 --> 00:44:53,310
I treated you to dinner at Hanilgwan.

703
00:44:53,350 --> 00:44:54,050
Right, right, right.

704
00:44:54,090 --> 00:44:54,710
Jung-jae.

705
00:44:55,070 --> 00:44:55,730
It's been a long time.

706
00:44:56,070 --> 00:44:56,750
How have you been?

707
00:44:57,010 --> 00:44:57,190
Yes.

708
00:44:57,630 --> 00:44:59,510
I opened a small store in the market.

709
00:44:59,830 --> 00:45:00,050
So?

710
00:45:00,530 --> 00:45:01,790
Is there a problem?

711
00:45:02,690 --> 00:45:07,340
Kim Du-han's underlings have been showing up in front of my store lately and causing trouble.

712
00:45:07,430 --> 00:45:07,830
Du-han?

713
00:45:08,410 --> 00:45:14,410
Seeing them cause trouble in a place even you don't frequent, sir, it's clear Kim Du-han has other intentions.

714
00:45:14,530 --> 00:45:18,770
If you just give me permission, sir, I'll meet Kim Du-han myself and teach him a lesson.

715
00:45:18,810 --> 00:45:19,810
You don't have to.

716
00:45:20,610 --> 00:45:21,970
Just run your business well.

717
00:45:22,010 --> 00:45:23,550
I'll teach that Du-han kid a lesson myself.

718
00:45:23,590 --> 00:45:24,590
No, sir.

719
00:45:24,950 --> 00:45:30,190
He's an underling you raised yourself, sir. It must be difficult for you in many ways. I'll do it myself...

720
00:45:30,230 --> 00:45:33,180
I told you, just mind your own business and run your store.

721
00:45:33,830 --> 00:45:34,850
Hey, call Du-han.

722
00:45:38,230 --> 00:45:46,190
I raised a snot-nosed kid who sold fish-shaped bread in a theater, and now he thinks he can take me on?

723
00:45:47,650 --> 00:45:48,270
No, sir.

724
00:45:48,310 --> 00:45:50,470
What do you mean, no, you bastard?

725
00:45:50,930 --> 00:45:52,730
Do you want to die by my hand today?

726
00:45:55,470 --> 00:45:56,690
I'd be honored, sir.

727
00:45:58,050 --> 00:46:00,310
Please kill me.

728
00:46:01,610 --> 00:46:02,790
What are you doing?

729
00:46:05,770 --> 00:46:10,550
You took me in when I was just a street urchin selling things.

730
00:46:11,750 --> 00:46:15,690
If it wasn't for you, sir, I'd still be selling chrysanthemum bread.

731
00:46:16,150 --> 00:46:16,550
But...

732
00:46:16,590 --> 00:46:22,810
I, Kim Du-han, may not be a very smart man, but I never forget a debt.

733
00:46:23,850 --> 00:46:32,450
No matter how the world changes, even if the sky and the earth were to grind together, you will always be my boss.

734
00:46:33,130 --> 00:46:34,290
So what, you bastard!

735
00:46:36,470 --> 00:46:39,590
I want to be a loyal subordinate who speaks the truth to such a boss.

736
00:46:39,630 --> 00:46:41,170
Your reputation has been tarnished, sir.

737
00:46:41,210 --> 00:46:42,710
You've changed too much, sir!

738
00:46:43,910 --> 00:46:45,310
You've really grown up, haven't you?

739
00:46:45,350 --> 00:46:47,830
Who cooked the meat today?

740
00:46:48,050 --> 00:46:49,050
Was it Anseong-daek?

741
00:46:50,370 --> 00:46:55,930
You didn't cut the meat to my liking, so didn't I have to pull out a knife to cut it myself?

742
00:46:57,390 --> 00:46:58,830
Cut this piece again.

743
00:47:02,650 --> 00:47:03,750
What's this?

744
00:47:05,450 --> 00:47:07,800
I didn't call for a sixty-year-old grandmother.

745
00:47:07,930 --> 00:47:09,630
The winter drought must be severe.

746
00:47:10,470 --> 00:47:15,310
It seems not only the old trees have withered and died, but also the handsome men.

747
00:47:16,630 --> 00:47:18,970
You can't find a real man anywhere.

748
00:47:19,970 --> 00:47:20,970
What?

749
00:47:30,310 --> 00:47:38,950
Do you know that there isn't a single person in this town who doesn't know that you'd dance in your underwear in front of rich foreigners to make money?

750
00:47:39,630 --> 00:47:41,730
If you're going to know, know it properly.

751
00:47:43,050 --> 00:47:45,650
That time, it wasn't my underwear, it was a slip.

752
00:47:46,030 --> 00:47:50,030
A slip or whatever, what do I care what women wear under their clothes?

753
00:47:50,070 --> 00:47:51,070
Hey!

754
00:47:52,810 --> 00:47:59,650
When I see men who just talk big like you, chirping like sparrows, I can't help but laugh.

755
00:48:00,610 --> 00:48:01,870
You son of a bitch!

756
00:48:32,890 --> 00:48:33,890
Sir.

757
00:48:35,950 --> 00:48:36,950
I'm sorry.

758
00:48:40,440 --> 00:48:43,720
I never thought the day would come when I'd have to take off my jacket in front of you, sir.

759
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:44,760
Thank you.

760
00:48:45,640 --> 00:48:49,340
Since you're showing me respect, I should do the same.

761
00:48:57,480 --> 00:48:59,380
I hope I won't have to use this knife.

762
00:49:01,300 --> 00:49:07,080
If you ever let me get hit on purpose, that knife will be stuck in your heart.

763
00:49:27,390 --> 00:49:28,390
Let go!

764
00:49:29,870 --> 00:49:30,870
Anchovy!

765
00:49:31,150 --> 00:49:33,990
Let's have a good, hard fight until our bones are crushed.

766
00:49:34,030 --> 00:49:42,570
It's been 30 years in Jongno, 30 years with these fists. Just as my
sister was crazy about the Boss, are you crazy about that woman?

767
00:49:42,950 --> 00:49:44,500
I can only think of that woman.

768
00:49:44,790 --> 00:49:46,890
Did that Kim Chunsam person give you that?

769
00:49:47,143 --> 00:49:47,563
Ah!

770
00:49:47,650 --> 00:49:48,650
Please!

771
00:49:48,710 --> 00:49:51,960
They will never put a prisoner in a hospital gown on the gallows.

772
00:49:52,170 --> 00:49:53,570
Min-jae is in that hospital?

773
00:49:53,970 --> 00:49:54,970
Fine.

774
00:49:55,630 --> 00:49:56,630
I'm going in again.
