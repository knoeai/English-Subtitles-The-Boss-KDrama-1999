1
00:00:01,990 --> 00:00:02,990
Chunsam!

2
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:04,720
Kim Du-han?

3
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:06,100
You're dead today.

4
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:08,820
You are so dead by my hands today.

5
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:11,760
Come here!

6
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:13,610
Do you know who I am?

7
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:15,140
I'm Dokkae of Namdaemun.

8
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:16,940
You're Kim Du-han?

9
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:18,640
You're dead today.

10
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:20,700
Bring it on.

12
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:26,570
A bit fast.

13
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:27,750
Yeah.

14
00:00:32,530 --> 00:00:33,530
Ma'am!

15
00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:36,330
Seems a little fast.

16
00:00:36,650 --> 00:00:37,650
Are you laughing?

17
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:39,130
For real?

18
00:00:39,610 --> 00:00:40,760
Now you're really dead.

19
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:42,110
You're dead now.

20
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:44,590
Didn't hit me.

21
00:00:44,810 --> 00:00:45,810
Didn't hit me.

22
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:48,490
I just fell.

23
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:52,440
He's losing his strength.

24
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:57,070
What are you guys doing?

25
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:13,560
Where is this?

26
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:15,140
Huh?

27
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:16,520
Is this Jongno?

28
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:17,620
Is this Namdaemun?

29
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:21,320
No, that's not it. We were on our way
to Namdaemun and just stopped by...

30
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:24,310
If you were on your way to Namdaemun, then just keep going.

31
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:25,940
Don't cause any trouble.

32
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:29,850
Actually, I was planning to visit you and pay my respects, sir...

33
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:36,920
You just stay in your own turf and
live well. That's all the greeting I need.

34
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:38,800
Go.

35
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:41,440
Yes.

36
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:49,190
And you.

37
00:01:50,230 --> 00:01:52,290
Are you some back-alley mutt?

38
00:01:54,650 --> 00:01:55,900
I asked if you're a mutt.

39
00:01:57,670 --> 00:02:00,610
If you fight with a guy like that, you become a mutt too.

40
00:02:01,910 --> 00:02:02,910
A mutt.

41
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:10,590
Do well, man.

42
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:14,970
Alright, let's go.

43
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:16,630
Let's go have some more fun.

44
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:19,390
Come here, come here.

45
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:22,870
Who are they?

46
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:28,030
They're from Hyuyanggak. All the
pretty girls in the city are gathered there.

47
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:29,810
Follow those girls.

48
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:31,070
What's the use of being pretty?

49
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:32,630
It's all pie in the sky.

50
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:37,510
Still, they must eat well. Their faces are glowing.

51
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:39,590
Hey, what are you doing?

52
00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:40,710
Hurry up, man.

53
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:09,930
An engagement present.

54
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:19,120
It's the strongest and most beautiful thing in the world.

55
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:22,050
Do you know what it is?

56
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:37,220
Liberty, my love.

57
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:39,680
For you, I would give my life.

58
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:41,200
But, my love.

59
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:45,780
For liberty, I would give even you.

60
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:51,190
A patriotic poet from Hungary wrote it. What do you think, Han-young?

61
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:54,100
Are you serious about this, Min-jae?

62
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:03,440
Do you regret it?

63
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,280
Not once.

64
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:07,540
Are you scared?

65
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,480
Don't worry.

66
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:19,780
I'll hold your hand until the very end.

67
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:23,410
I'll ask you one more time.

68
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:26,700
Are you serious about this, Min-jae?

69
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:37,520
Hey, which one is it that you, the political Pollack, want?

70
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:39,900
That one, that one.

71
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:46,900
I thought the leather had gone into your hat, but it
seems there's still something visible in your eye holes.

72
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:53,000
Sis, if I wear that, won't I look like that
actor from the motion pictures back then?

73
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,120
No.

74
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:56,460
What do you think you'll look more like?

75
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:57,580
A Yeomcheon Bridge beggar.

76
00:04:57,620 --> 00:05:00,870
Stop with the nonsense. I'll keep watch, so you go in and get it.

77
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:01,740
You go, sis.

78
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:03,020
I'll keep watch.

79
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,520
Hey, this way, this way.

80
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,740
Sis, sis.

81
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:11,080
Are your legs okay?

82
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:12,460
Yeah, they're fine.

83
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:14,040
Damn mutt.

84
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,740
This is really cool.

85
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:19,280
Hey, it's a bit old, but it's a good Western-style suit.

86
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:23,660
If I wear this, I'll look way cooler than that actor guy.

87
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:28,200
There's only one man in the world who would look good in this outfit.

88
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:32,590
None.

89
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:36,010
You mean the son of the Mishikoshi department store owner?

90
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:43,110
While I was singing a folk song, he kept staring
at my face so hard it felt like it would get a scratch.

91
00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:45,010
When someone's singing, who are they supposed to look at?

92
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:46,050
The liquor bottle?

93
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:50,150
No, no, that's not it. He definitely thinks of me as special.

94
00:05:50,970 --> 00:05:57,450
When he's with his friends, he talks just fine,
but when I sit next to him, he keeps stuttering.

95
00:05:57,610 --> 00:05:59,260
He doesn't just do that with you.

96
00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:02,130
He stutters in front of any woman.

97
00:06:02,610 --> 00:06:03,030
Really?

98
00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:04,190
Really?

99
00:06:04,470 --> 00:06:04,750
Yeah.

100
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:08,550
One time, while I was serving
him burnt-rice water, I pinched the

101
00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:12,070
back of his hand, and he spilled
it all over his expensive silk pants.

102
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:13,110
Really?

103
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:16,070
Right in the middle, too.

104
00:06:16,530 --> 00:06:17,530
So?

105
00:06:17,890 --> 00:06:20,490
I wiped it all off for him with a silk handkerchief.

106
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:21,530
Thoroughly.

107
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:25,730
Jin-young, what happened to those expensive
suit pants he ruined with the burnt-rice water?

108
00:06:25,770 --> 00:06:26,350
Did you wash them?

109
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:29,710
No, he's rich. What are some silk pants to him?

110
00:06:30,170 --> 00:06:31,270
He doesn't have money.

111
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:34,450
His father has a lot of money.

112
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:38,090
There's something I absolutely must teach you two today.

113
00:06:38,570 --> 00:06:38,910
What is it?

114
00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:40,830
Today, you'll learn for real.

115
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:41,870
Learn what?

116
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:43,870
How great money is.

117
00:06:44,590 --> 00:06:47,990
Hey, but only loafers like this come here.

118
00:06:48,850 --> 00:06:51,490
Man, I wonder if it's okay. Double-Blade might be here.

119
00:06:51,530 --> 00:06:52,730
I've never been here before...

120
00:06:52,770 --> 00:06:53,910
Du-han, what's wrong?

121
00:06:54,030 --> 00:06:55,750
You have to play where the big shots are.

122
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:58,150
The three of us will team up and get rid of Dokkae.

123
00:06:58,190 --> 00:07:00,330
We'll take over everything from Jingogae to Jangchungdan!

124
00:07:00,370 --> 00:07:00,670
What do you think?

125
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:01,670
Right, Chunsam?

126
00:07:02,010 --> 00:07:02,190
Yeah.

127
00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:02,770
Yeah.

128
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:04,290
Follow me!

129
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,360
Is anyone there?

130
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:22,420
Hey... is anyone home?

131
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:24,660
Hmm?

132
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:31,300
Du-han of Jongno is here for a drink!

133
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:57,660
Enjoy your meal.

134
00:07:58,260 --> 00:07:59,260
Uh-huh.

135
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,200
Uh-huh.

136
00:08:13,690 --> 00:08:14,330
Alright!

137
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:15,010
It's done!

138
00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:15,490
It's done!

139
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:18,950
Hey, relax your shoulders and sit down.

140
00:08:20,090 --> 00:08:22,070
I've got the owner of this place completely wrapped around my finger.

141
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:24,430
A pretty girl named Gye-hyang will be coming in.

142
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:24,470
Huh?

143
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:26,290
Hey, what for?

144
00:08:27,150 --> 00:08:29,750
She'll pour our drinks... so what's wrong with that?

145
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:32,030
It's better to have a pretty girl, my friend.

146
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:35,770
If you're going to drink, it's better to
have something nice to look at, right?

147
00:08:35,810 --> 00:08:36,810
Come on.

148
00:08:36,970 --> 00:08:38,590
A girl is just a girl.

149
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:43,410
She doesn't have to be that pretty. Just
meet up occasionally and relieve some stress.

150
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:47,090
Hey, I have to go first.

151
00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:48,210
What's wrong?

152
00:08:48,730 --> 00:08:49,210
What's wrong?

153
00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:51,690
We haven't even finished talking about stabbing Dokki's underling!

154
00:08:51,730 --> 00:08:53,210
Let's talk about that later.

155
00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:55,950
Man, later is later, and now is now!

156
00:08:56,210 --> 00:08:56,950
Hey, where are you going?

157
00:08:57,070 --> 00:08:58,110
You have to eat this and go.

158
00:08:58,150 --> 00:09:00,873
Hey, a guy who used to
roll around in a shack is now

159
00:09:00,893 --> 00:09:04,050
sitting in a place like this,
my butt's starting to get sore.

160
00:09:04,850 --> 00:09:05,850
Hey!

161
00:09:06,190 --> 00:09:06,350
Hey!

162
00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:07,490
Hey, hey, Chunsam!

163
00:09:07,530 --> 00:09:10,790
Hey, with this, our kids can go to Seoul.

164
00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:12,030
We're having a big feast tonight.

165
00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:12,870
Hey, what's wrong with you?

166
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:13,390
Sit down.

167
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:14,390
Hey, I ate well. I'm leaving.

168
00:09:14,690 --> 00:09:15,690
Hey, hey, come here!

169
00:09:16,330 --> 00:09:16,830
Hey, stop!

170
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:18,490
Oh my, oh my, oh my.

171
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:23,010
A year of reverse vegetables, and one
person is specially taken care of in the kitchen.

172
00:09:23,050 --> 00:09:24,610
I came to see you today.

173
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:27,910
Ah,

174
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:05,460
Tongs.

175
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:08,580
Hey!

176
00:10:36,950 --> 00:10:38,650
Oh, of course.

177
00:10:40,370 --> 00:10:43,710
Well, if it isn't Mr. Kim of Yeomcheon Bridge, where have you been?

178
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:47,030
Hey, if it wasn't for me, would you ever
have come to a place like this in your life?

179
00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:49,520
Thanks to you, I really did come to a nice place.

180
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:52,290
Yeah, it'll be a night you'll never forget.

181
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:57,610
If you want to make it an unforgettable night, do me one favor.

182
00:10:58,030 --> 00:10:59,030
What?

183
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:02,390
Over there, the picture taken at the big drinking party.

184
00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:04,010
Who is the dancing lady?

185
00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:05,690
You mean Haewol.

186
00:11:05,850 --> 00:11:07,000
Call that woman for me.

187
00:11:07,810 --> 00:11:09,570
Hey, hey, just drink.

188
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:12,510
Once you strip a woman down, they're all the same.

189
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:12,890
Call her.

190
00:11:12,990 --> 00:11:13,490
It'll only take a moment.

191
00:11:14,010 --> 00:11:15,010
You dream big.

192
00:11:15,290 --> 00:11:18,090
How can you call a girl who is entertaining the
high-ranking officials from the Government-General?

193
00:11:18,130 --> 00:11:19,650
Hyeongdo, please.

194
00:11:20,190 --> 00:11:21,350
Let's just drink, huh?

195
00:11:23,230 --> 00:11:24,230
Don't worry.

196
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:24,970
What was her name?

197
00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:26,210
Haewol or Gaewol?

198
00:11:26,570 --> 00:11:27,670
I'll call her for you.

199
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:29,470
Oh!

200
00:11:30,010 --> 00:11:31,490
Madam, I know this is difficult, but...

201
00:11:31,530 --> 00:11:33,650
I have a favor to ask.

202
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:35,850
There's an order to socializing.

203
00:11:36,710 --> 00:11:39,470
Besides, first impressions are very important.

204
00:11:39,570 --> 00:11:43,530
No, just a brief greeting, and then I'll...

205
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:45,970
There's a proper way to do things, President Im.

206
00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:53,090
No, I've wanted to meet the elders of
the Government-General for a while.

207
00:11:53,130 --> 00:11:55,270
Especially Abe of Jongno Police Station, huh?

208
00:11:55,310 --> 00:11:58,110
I have a lot of business to see Abe-nari about...

209
00:11:58,150 --> 00:11:59,500
That's right, President Im.

210
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:05,810
It's not proper to barge in and ask to meet
high-ranking Japanese officials after only two meetings.

211
00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:08,420
Especially without a prior appointment.

212
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:15,780
Ah, well, then I guess there's nothing I can do.

213
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:18,614
Well, then, since it's a shame,
please call out that girl in

214
00:12:18,634 --> 00:12:21,100
the room, Haewol or whatever
her name is, for a moment.

215
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:23,040
That's not a difficult request, is it?

216
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,170
If it's your date of birth...

217
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:30,160
What...

218
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:40,700
Your birth date and time, I mean.

219
00:12:44,690 --> 00:12:47,250
Ah... how would I know that?

220
00:12:49,950 --> 00:12:50,950
You?

221
00:12:53,030 --> 00:12:56,650
Ah, I've been wandering around since I was
a kid, how would I know something like that?

222
00:12:56,690 --> 00:12:58,610
Mr. Kim, that's really...

223
00:12:58,650 --> 00:13:00,650
No, why do you need to know that anyway?

224
00:13:00,850 --> 00:13:03,890
The madam's greatest hobby is reading people's fortunes.

225
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:08,610
First, she looks at your face, and if she
thinks you're going to be big, she treats you well.

226
00:13:08,650 --> 00:13:11,250
What a crappy hobby.

227
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:13,090
What would a beggar know about that?

228
00:13:13,130 --> 00:13:14,610
Here, have a drink, Mr. Kim.

229
00:13:15,130 --> 00:13:16,130
What's wrong?

230
00:13:16,650 --> 00:13:20,350
Anyway, if you don't know your
fortune, it's hard to see that girl's face?

231
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:38,320
Hey, are you that Gaewol... no, hey, are you Haewol?

232
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:44,120
I, I don't know.

233
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:46,790
Hey, have you been here before?

234
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:48,580
I'm... I'm Mr. Kim from Yeomcheon Bridge...

235
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:50,120
Hey, wait, just wait a minute.

236
00:13:55,430 --> 00:13:57,310
A long time ago in Daegu...

237
00:13:57,350 --> 00:14:00,550
The madam told me to write down your fortune and send it to her.

238
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:09,920
Surely the children of high-ranking
officials wouldn't be ignorant of their fortunes...

239
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:18,060
If their fortunes aren't clear, she said to show
her your palm after the drinking party is over.

240
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:23,400
Giminy-eon, March 1st, noon.

241
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:29,260
That's a pure dog's fortune.

242
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,780
Your birth date is all wrong, you bastard.

243
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:33,010
Your palm, your palm.

244
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:36,170
Even Park Bosal said you were destined to live by your fists.

245
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,700
There's nothing good about it.

246
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:40,380
What more is there to fight for?

247
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:42,520
You're so great.

248
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:45,020
I don't know what's so great about you.

249
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,540
Anyway, you're great.

250
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:48,020
What did he say earlier?

251
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:50,520
That you were fated to be a beggar and a saint?

252
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:51,900
Ugh, it's complicated.

253
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:53,660
Ugh, what a beggar-like guy.

254
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:57,940
Still, I'm the best.

255
00:14:58,420 --> 00:15:02,440
If it wasn't for me, when would you two ever
get to drink at a thousand-won charcoal fire?

256
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,830
You guys heard that, right?

257
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,500
Dohwasal, Dohwasal.

258
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:09,520
Yes, he said I would be very successful if I worked in motion pictures.

259
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:15,000
I'm going to own the biggest theater in
Joseon and only show movies I've made.

260
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:20,060
Then I'll let you two watch for free every day.

261
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:20,600
For free!

262
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:22,140
Hey, you take care of this.

263
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:23,690
You guys go down first.

264
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:25,610
Hey, where are you going?

265
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:28,740
Chunsam, I'm telling you, she's not Gaewol.

266
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:31,600
Hey, you're confusing her with another girl.

267
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:39,780
Excuse me.

268
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:42,110
Just a moment, I need to check something.

269
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:43,860
Don't block me.

270
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:46,340
Excuse me.

271
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:10,160
You really don't know me?

272
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:20,380
A long time ago in Daegu, when those
Japanese gangster punks stole my fountain pen.

273
00:16:23,330 --> 00:16:24,330
Daegu?

274
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:27,050
Yes, those Japanese judo kids.

275
00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:29,510
That time, I got your fountain pen back for you.

276
00:16:31,410 --> 00:16:32,410
Do you remember?

277
00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:37,510
When I came to your house back then, you gave me food.

278
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:41,750
Ah, then that beggar from back then...

279
00:16:41,790 --> 00:16:42,790
Yes, that's right.

280
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:43,730
So you do remember.

281
00:16:43,770 --> 00:16:45,770
Now in Gyeongseong...

282
00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:54,810
Yes, I came up to Gyeongseong and
I'm doing some business here and there...

283
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:57,530
Wow, you remember.

284
00:16:58,330 --> 00:17:01,030
That time in front of the rice mill, I
got your fountain pen back for you...

285
00:17:01,070 --> 00:17:02,290
So what about it?

286
00:17:05,410 --> 00:17:08,560
I remember, but there's no need to remember it again, is there?

287
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:11,610
Haewol, hurry up and come in.

288
00:17:12,610 --> 00:17:14,150
Please be careful on your way.

289
00:18:35,410 --> 00:18:36,410
Boss!

290
00:18:43,310 --> 00:18:44,560
What are you doing there?

291
00:18:52,630 --> 00:18:54,230
I said, what are you doing here?

292
00:18:57,910 --> 00:19:02,410
Well, some rich idiot threw this away.

293
00:19:02,450 --> 00:19:04,290
So I picked it up.

294
00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:09,130
Hey, we should all gather and share something like this.

295
00:19:10,910 --> 00:19:14,090
Since we can't tear it apart, just wear it, Boss.

296
00:19:15,710 --> 00:19:16,930
It looks like a fly, put it on.

297
00:19:16,970 --> 00:19:17,750
No, no.

298
00:19:17,870 --> 00:19:19,310
The Boss has to wear this.

299
00:19:19,490 --> 00:19:20,490
Let's see.

300
00:19:21,690 --> 00:19:23,610
You'll look so cool with this on.

301
00:19:23,890 --> 00:19:24,890
I said it's okay.

302
00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:31,100
My sister worked so hard to get this
for the Boss, how can you not wear it?

303
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:38,920
My sister almost got bitten to death by a dog while stealing this.

304
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:44,140
Didn't I tell you that you should never steal?

305
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:49,850
Didn't I say I'd kick you out of the shack if you ever steal again?

306
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,760
Is it okay for a girl to be running around stealing?

307
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,900
You can just throw it back in that house's yard right now.

308
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:00,680
Sis!

309
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:02,160
What did I do?

310
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:04,360
You heard him, right?

311
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:06,600
Yeah, the Boss is really mean.

312
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,160
So what if I brought back some pollack?

313
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:09,200
Not that.

314
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:15,040
He called me a girl.

315
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:17,480
So are you a boy, sis?

316
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:20,410
Look, do I look like a girl in any way?

317
00:20:23,550 --> 00:20:27,550
But the Boss called me a girl.

318
00:20:30,070 --> 00:20:31,590
I feel so sorry for you, sis.

319
00:20:32,850 --> 00:20:35,790
By the way, are you really going to return this now?

320
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:37,430
I can't even collect my dues properly.

321
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:38,690
Oh, you idiot!

322
00:20:42,050 --> 00:20:43,050
What is it?

323
00:20:43,470 --> 00:20:47,670
This is the guy who's been hanging around
for days, saying he has to greet you, sir.

324
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:02,510
Nice to meet you.

325
00:21:04,370 --> 00:21:11,030
I'm seeing you for the first time, but I've heard
your name so much it's made my ears bleed.

326
00:21:12,030 --> 00:21:13,030
Is that so?

327
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:14,970
Not really.

328
00:21:16,030 --> 00:21:23,610
Ever since I was a kid, I thought Dokkae
was the greatest man after Admiral Yi Sun-sin.

329
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:28,750
I've respected you for a long time.

330
00:21:30,090 --> 00:21:31,590
How did you get here?

331
00:21:32,570 --> 00:21:42,070
Being in front of you like this, my heart is pounding
like a girl in love. I can't express how good I feel.

332
00:21:42,810 --> 00:21:46,710
Stop with the flattery and get to the point.

333
00:21:47,670 --> 00:21:54,050
A few days ago, I heard you were disgraced because of that Anchovy punk.

334
00:21:55,630 --> 00:21:56,630
So?

335
00:21:57,530 --> 00:22:02,968
It's my wish to have a drink
over that bastard's corpse.

336
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:08,830
I'll take the lead in catching
and killing that Anchovy punk.

337
00:22:13,510 --> 00:22:15,790
He's as stubborn as bamboo.

338
00:22:24,630 --> 00:22:27,930
Just punch him hard in the stomach. What a bastard.

339
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:52,860
Yeon-ji, someone's here to see you.

340
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:55,500
Oh.

341
00:22:58,550 --> 00:23:04,770
Yeon-ji, Ae-sim, how did you get here?

342
00:23:04,890 --> 00:23:05,670
What about school?

343
00:23:05,710 --> 00:23:07,070
Hey, that's great.

344
00:23:07,490 --> 00:23:10,290
You're still the precious daughter of
a rich family, no matter where you go.

345
00:23:10,330 --> 00:23:14,030
I'm not the precious daughter of a
rich family anymore, so don't say that.

346
00:23:14,370 --> 00:23:16,150
It reminds me of my school days.

347
00:23:16,710 --> 00:23:18,260
Are all the dancers doing well?

348
00:23:18,470 --> 00:23:20,550
It's been three years since I came to Gyeongseong.

349
00:23:20,590 --> 00:23:23,390
I can speak the Gyeongseong dialect well now.

350
00:23:24,330 --> 00:23:28,190
You said you were attending a
professional school. What's it like these days?

351
00:23:28,590 --> 00:23:31,520
Every day as soon as the sun
rises, we put on our leggings

352
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:34,540
and work pants, and do military
and anti-communist training.

353
00:23:35,790 --> 00:23:37,490
How's my Gyeongseong accent?

354
00:23:37,910 --> 00:23:38,910
Oh, you girl.

355
00:23:39,230 --> 00:23:40,530
You should have told me earlier.

356
00:23:40,570 --> 00:23:41,570
It's cold inside.

357
00:23:41,770 --> 00:23:42,150
What?

358
00:23:42,630 --> 00:23:44,090
What did you just say?

359
00:23:44,610 --> 00:23:46,950
Do you have to take a test to become a gisaeng?

360
00:23:46,990 --> 00:23:50,140
No matter how hard school is, it's better than being a gisaeng.

361
00:23:51,130 --> 00:23:54,530
It's not that I want to wear fancy clothes and makeup like you.

362
00:23:56,050 --> 00:23:59,970
My father is trying to marry me off to the eldest son of a mill owner.

363
00:24:01,150 --> 00:24:04,110
You know how much I hate that pimple-faced guy, right?

364
00:24:04,150 --> 00:24:11,570
Whenever he sees me, he grins with those yellow teeth.
Just seeing the back of his neck gives me goosebumps.

365
00:24:11,870 --> 00:24:12,790
But still...

366
00:24:12,830 --> 00:24:17,730
Wouldn't it be better to just hang myself than
to marry a guy like that and live a miserable life?

367
00:24:19,090 --> 00:24:21,030
I ran away from home to die.

368
00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:27,600
But I thought it would be better to be a gisaeng
than to die, so I came to you for help, Yeon-ji.

369
00:24:30,250 --> 00:24:34,550
You only live once and die once,
but I really don't want to live like this.

370
00:24:34,710 --> 00:24:38,910
I'm a woman too, and I'm young. Shouldn't
I at least get to bloom once before I die?

371
00:24:39,770 --> 00:24:40,770
The flower of youth?

372
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:47,430
That kind of flower doesn't even sprout in a gisaeng house.

373
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:49,730
I'm not doing this because I like it.

374
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:54,280
I'll only be a gisaeng for three years,
and after that, I'll live doing what I want.

375
00:24:55,820 --> 00:24:56,860
A gisaeng is a gisaeng.

376
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:58,500
It's different from other women.

377
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:02,100
Gisaengs wear their skirts tied to the right like this.

378
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:03,540
Do you know what this means?

379
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:07,600
It means anyone can lift your skirt.

380
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:08,220
As long as they have money.

381
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:09,120
Do you understand now?

382
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:09,840
Do you still like it?

383
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:11,640
Do you still want to be a gisaeng?

384
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:13,020
Yes.

385
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:17,050
I want to be like Hwang Jin-yi.

386
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:19,977
Yes, I hate the idea of
getting married and living a

387
00:25:19,997 --> 00:25:22,740
miserable life looking at only one
man's face for the rest of my life.

388
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:25,810
Like Hwang Jin-yi, I want to
live a fiery life, breaking the

389
00:25:25,830 --> 00:25:28,730
will of meditating monks and
making arrogant men cry. Yes.

390
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:32,960
You were born with the fate of a courtesan.

391
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:35,870
You're completely different from her.

392
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:38,940
Where did you bring a girl like this from?

393
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:41,870
Ae-sim and I have been best friends since we were little.

394
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:45,970
I don't know what you'll think
of her at first, but if you spend

395
00:25:45,990 --> 00:25:48,580
time with her, you'll soon see
that she's a really good person...

396
00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:51,210
Haewol, you weren't originally
fated to be a gisaeng, you're

397
00:25:51,230 --> 00:25:53,840
just passing through, but she's
the complete opposite of you.

398
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:55,620
That's right.

399
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:58,840
She and I have always been opposites since we were kids.

400
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:01,190
You need to fix your way of speaking first.

401
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:02,280
Pardon?

402
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:04,320
Your dialect.

403
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:09,480
I can speak the Gyeongseong dialect well.

404
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:15,600
You haven't seen each other in a while,
why don't you go out and get some fresh air?

405
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:19,180
But tonight there's an important engagement...

406
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:24,100
From now on, you'll be tied down anyway,
so I'm giving you special time off today.

407
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:25,120
That's great.

408
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:27,680
A new movie starring Moon Ye-bong
is playing at Umigwan. Let's go see it.

409
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:30,220
It would be nice if you could come with us, ma'am.

410
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:17,540
The instruments?

411
00:27:19,490 --> 00:27:21,750
Is the performance ready?

412
00:27:24,810 --> 00:27:26,340
Are you still scared?

413
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:33,980
I trust you, Han-hyuk.

414
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:38,940
Why?

415
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:41,300
I'm not confident.

416
00:27:42,740 --> 00:27:43,000
No.

417
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:43,820
Be confident.

418
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:45,190
You have to be confident.

419
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:48,820
I got this new from the Soviets.

420
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:49,880
It's very accurate.

421
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:52,390
And there are three extra rounds.

422
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:55,720
Leave the bag and get out immediately.

423
00:27:55,820 --> 00:27:57,880
You know how powerful the gunpowder is, right?

424
00:27:57,920 --> 00:28:03,120
Don't worry about me. Just wait by the
river until nightfall, and a carriage will come.

425
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:06,420
Change carriages at the intersection
and go straight to the pier in Incheon.

426
00:28:06,460 --> 00:28:07,080
When you get to the pier...

427
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:10,680
I know to look for a boat with a red flag on its mast.

428
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:29,460
Min-ja.

429
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:42,100
If by some chance something goes wrong...

430
00:28:42,140 --> 00:28:43,900
Even if you say that...

431
00:28:58,040 --> 00:28:59,300
We have to prepare.

432
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:41,400
Min-jeong, you did well.

433
00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:42,980
I need to go left.

434
00:31:43,060 --> 00:31:44,060
Hurry!

435
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:10,500
Oh, I think I'm going to throw up from the smell of alcohol.

436
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:16,200
Damn, what the hell happened?

437
00:33:16,740 --> 00:33:17,740
What's this?

438
00:33:18,060 --> 00:33:19,060
Hey!

439
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:29,820
Do you want me to watch you drink?

440
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:32,960
Hey!

441
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:34,660
Have you seen a tall guy?

442
00:33:35,260 --> 00:33:36,260
No.

443
00:33:36,340 --> 00:33:37,340
Did you see him?

444
00:33:37,940 --> 00:33:39,020
I didn't see him.

445
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:40,730
Hurry up and clean up, man.

446
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:45,640
Aren't we doing something pointless?

447
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:47,760
We don't know where this dog bone came from.

448
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:50,640
We don't know where this dog bone came from either.

449
00:33:59,670 --> 00:34:00,670
Thank you.

450
00:34:09,220 --> 00:34:12,140
Sis, let's give this to Grasshopper hyung and get something to eat.

451
00:34:12,180 --> 00:34:12,440
No.

452
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:14,200
The Boss told us not to bother him.

453
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:16,240
Do you know why the shoes I shine don't shine?

454
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:16,480
Why?

455
00:34:16,820 --> 00:34:17,400
Is Grasshopper hyung here?

456
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:17,840
Yeah.

457
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:19,520
Look.

458
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:21,150
It's because my spit is thin.

459
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:26,860
You're supposed to use spit more than polish when you
shine shoes, but since I only eat garbage porridge, huh?

460
00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:27,760
My spit is thin.

461
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:30,480
And no matter how much I shine them, they don't seem to shine?

462
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:32,140
It's so unfair to eat the same thing.

463
00:34:32,180 --> 00:34:33,180
Sis!

464
00:34:33,620 --> 00:34:34,620
Hey, Crow!

465
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:36,340
Damn it, you!

466
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:37,320
Hey!

467
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:38,500
You wanna die!

468
00:34:40,460 --> 00:34:41,460
Ah, Crow!

469
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:42,760
Grasshopper hyung!

470
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:43,880
What are you doing?

471
00:34:44,260 --> 00:34:44,680
There's a lot.

472
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:45,380
What are you doing?

473
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:46,500
Ah, this, this.

474
00:34:46,740 --> 00:34:47,480
Should we go back inside?

475
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:49,200
Oppa, I'll take some wood.

476
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:51,620
Hand, hand, hand, hand!

477
00:34:51,660 --> 00:34:52,660
Hand, hand, hand!

478
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:55,160
Sir, I'll clean this up for you.

479
00:34:55,580 --> 00:34:56,580
Okay.

480
00:35:08,570 --> 00:35:11,570
Oh, that's just for Yeomcheon Bridge. Why did you come here?

481
00:35:12,030 --> 00:35:13,490
She's one of Chunsam's girls.

482
00:35:13,990 --> 00:35:14,990
Is that so?

483
00:35:26,590 --> 00:35:29,990
I can't tell if this is a boy or a girl just by looking at the face.

484
00:35:30,970 --> 00:35:32,720
You'll have to go to the bathhouse.

485
00:35:33,270 --> 00:35:37,010
You'll have to roll around for about
three days to get the old dirt off, huh?

486
00:35:37,050 --> 00:35:37,610
Damn it!

487
00:35:38,050 --> 00:35:39,050
Ah!

488
00:35:43,350 --> 00:35:44,730
You disrespectful...

489
00:35:45,190 --> 00:35:46,590
This bastard!

490
00:35:53,950 --> 00:35:54,310
Hey!

491
00:35:54,470 --> 00:35:54,850
Hey, grab her face!

492
00:35:55,050 --> 00:35:56,050
Hey, grab her face!

493
00:35:56,190 --> 00:35:58,250
Hey, do we have to gag her?

494
00:35:58,470 --> 00:36:00,070
What if she bites her tongue and dies?

495
00:36:00,110 --> 00:36:02,070
You bastard, why, why would she bite her tongue?

496
00:36:02,110 --> 00:36:03,930
Hey, it's okay, it's okay.

497
00:36:03,990 --> 00:36:04,750
Stay quiet.

498
00:36:04,870 --> 00:36:05,110
Hey, hold her tight!

499
00:36:05,310 --> 00:36:05,670
I'm going in!

500
00:36:05,770 --> 00:36:07,220
I'm going in, hold her tight!

501
00:36:09,610 --> 00:36:10,610
Hey, hold her tight!

502
00:36:10,670 --> 00:36:11,670
Hold her tight!

503
00:36:12,510 --> 00:36:13,990
Hey, grab her shoulders, shoulders, shoulders!

504
00:36:14,030 --> 00:36:15,230
Hey, grab her shoulders!

505
00:36:19,250 --> 00:36:20,050
I let go, I let go, I let go!

506
00:36:20,090 --> 00:36:21,540
I let go, I let go, I let go!

507
00:36:21,850 --> 00:36:22,850
It's out!

508
00:36:26,930 --> 00:36:29,690
Because of something this small, people live and die...

509
00:36:29,730 --> 00:36:31,110
Hey, bring me something to burn.

510
00:36:31,150 --> 00:36:33,170
Hey, bring me something to burn.

511
00:36:34,590 --> 00:36:36,140
Bring the fire first, the fire!

512
00:36:36,210 --> 00:36:37,490
Hey, bring the fire!

513
00:36:37,790 --> 00:36:38,890
Hey, grab the noodles.

514
00:36:43,130 --> 00:36:44,280
Hey, you're alive, man.

515
00:36:48,090 --> 00:36:49,150
Hold tight, hold tight!

516
00:36:49,190 --> 00:36:50,190
Hey, hold tight!

517
00:36:56,170 --> 00:36:57,170
Is it done?

518
00:36:58,570 --> 00:36:59,990
She fainted from the fire.

519
00:37:01,990 --> 00:37:03,070
Hey, bring the charcoal.

520
00:37:03,110 --> 00:37:04,310
Hey, bring the charcoal.

521
00:37:05,030 --> 00:37:06,590
Hey, get some water.

522
00:37:06,930 --> 00:37:08,190
Hey, get some water.

523
00:37:08,750 --> 00:37:15,250
The Boss's skills are no joke. He cut the flesh in a
cross shape, put his finger in, and the bullet came out.

524
00:37:15,690 --> 00:37:18,770
But what if the wound gets infected?

525
00:37:19,190 --> 00:37:20,950
You bastard, I'm using charcoal right now.

526
00:37:20,990 --> 00:37:22,270
It'll be fine because it's charcoal.

527
00:37:22,310 --> 00:37:28,410
This is a matter of life and death, so I'm saying
this. I could go to the hospital and steal some...

528
00:37:28,450 --> 00:37:28,610
Hey, what is it, man?

529
00:37:29,330 --> 00:37:30,330
Hey, what happened?

530
00:37:33,810 --> 00:37:34,810
Young master!

531
00:37:36,270 --> 00:37:37,720
Young... young, young master!

532
00:37:38,310 --> 00:37:40,990
Young master, what are you doing in a place like this...

533
00:37:41,030 --> 00:37:44,750
So, is he the son of that rich family where you used to be a servant?

534
00:37:44,930 --> 00:37:45,290
Uh, uh.

535
00:37:45,910 --> 00:37:46,970
He's covered in blood.

536
00:37:47,010 --> 00:37:48,710
Did he have a major surgery?

537
00:37:49,250 --> 00:37:51,950
Boss, what happened to our young master?

538
00:37:52,450 --> 00:37:53,270
I don't know, man.

539
00:37:53,430 --> 00:37:54,630
Ask your young master.

540
00:37:55,230 --> 00:37:56,880
I'm getting some water right now.

541
00:37:57,530 --> 00:37:59,370
These kids are getting some water.

542
00:38:05,250 --> 00:38:06,250
Blood!

543
00:38:06,330 --> 00:38:07,330
Boss, what's wrong?

544
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:12,100
Why are you avoiding me?

545
00:38:12,340 --> 00:38:13,990
Hey, what's wrong with your face?

546
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:15,080
It's nothing.

547
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:18,980
Hey, I'm asking you what happened.

548
00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:20,060
I said it's nothing!

549
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:25,760
I went to the King Star, and I got hit by a new underling of Dokkae.

550
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:28,400
Was Dokkae there?

551
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:29,160
Yes.

552
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:31,900
My sister beat up the guy who hit me.

553
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:33,760
Who's Dokkae's underling?

554
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:35,960
Well, he's a really ugly guy.

555
00:38:36,060 --> 00:38:37,360
So, what's his name?

556
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:42,600
He's the guy who got hit by a dog, and I think Dokkae called him Toe.

557
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:43,920
Right, right?

558
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:45,360
Yeah.

559
00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:46,780
What?

560
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:47,920
Toe... Toe?

561
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:50,160
You mean Toe from Daegu came to Gyeongseong?

562
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:52,300
Are you sure it was Toe?

563
00:38:52,860 --> 00:38:54,980
Yes, that's what Dokkae said.

564
00:38:55,260 --> 00:38:58,420
I don't care if it's Toe or a finger,
I'm fine, so why do you keep asking?

565
00:38:58,460 --> 00:38:59,460
Where is he now?

566
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:00,720
I said I'm fine!

567
00:39:00,860 --> 00:39:01,860
Where is he!

568
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:04,540
He... he said he was going to Umigwan.

569
00:39:05,180 --> 00:39:06,640
He said he was going to see a movie...

570
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:06,740
Huh?

571
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:07,120
Boss!

572
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:08,100
Don't go!

573
00:39:08,180 --> 00:39:08,560
Boss!

574
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,000
Boss!

575
00:39:25,180 --> 00:39:27,140
Don't you guys ever kiss?

576
00:39:28,580 --> 00:39:33,680
You've been holding hands for a while now. I'm
going to die without seeing you two eat a wedding cake.

577
00:39:35,980 --> 00:39:38,540
Yeah, just watch them do their thing.

578
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:41,950
You don't even know you're about to fall off a cliff.

579
00:39:42,460 --> 00:39:45,320
If it's too much, just give up.

580
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:53,720
By the way, where is that delicious smell coming from?

581
00:39:59,590 --> 00:40:00,870
That's right, sir.

582
00:40:00,930 --> 00:40:02,070
You have a sharp nose.

583
00:40:04,790 --> 00:40:06,970
Is this the smell of sesame oil...

584
00:40:09,950 --> 00:40:11,910
or castor oil...

585
00:40:11,950 --> 00:40:14,650
There's a bean smell coming from someone.

586
00:40:36,970 --> 00:40:37,970
Ladies!

587
00:40:38,510 --> 00:40:40,490
Why do you want to step in dog poop and get hurt?

588
00:40:40,530 --> 00:40:42,030
Because I stepped in dog poop!

589
00:40:42,350 --> 00:40:43,350
What?

590
00:40:43,550 --> 00:40:44,550
That...

591
00:40:45,270 --> 00:40:46,910
The right one is the left one.

592
00:40:47,670 --> 00:40:52,250
No matter how you look at it, can you tell
the difference between weasel fur and pig fur?

593
00:40:54,330 --> 00:40:55,270
Even the right one...

594
00:40:55,310 --> 00:40:58,330
I'll have her in your arms tonight, so just stay put.

595
00:41:11,470 --> 00:41:14,970
I was just about to say hello, but it's a shame you're leaving.

596
00:41:24,540 --> 00:41:27,040
Sir, how many rickshaws should I call?

597
00:41:27,340 --> 00:41:28,960
Just one should be enough.

598
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:33,820
Hey!

599
00:41:37,060 --> 00:41:38,660
Why are you here?

600
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:41,120
I came to see a movie.

601
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:48,700
Didn't I tell you not to drink, watch
movies, or even pass through Jongno?

602
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:52,100
Do you own this place?

603
00:41:53,100 --> 00:41:57,680
Does a stray dog have to get your permission to take a dump here?

604
00:41:58,360 --> 00:42:03,860
Yeah, maybe not people, but stray
dogs and punks like you need permission.

605
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:22,480
Hey!

606
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:23,520
Hey,

607
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:28,780
Du-han, Du-han.

608
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:29,520
You saw Dokkae?

609
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:29,820
Where is he?

610
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:30,340
I don't know.

611
00:42:30,580 --> 00:42:30,980
I'm busy right now.

612
00:42:31,020 --> 00:42:31,160
Come on.

613
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:32,640
Where's that dog-eyed Toe?

614
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:35,440
He's dead, you bastard.

615
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:36,480
Du-han!

616
00:42:37,120 --> 00:42:38,120
Du-han!

617
00:42:42,930 --> 00:42:43,930
Anchovy.

618
00:42:44,150 --> 00:42:45,730
It's been a while.

619
00:42:48,430 --> 00:42:49,710
Let that woman go.

620
00:42:51,510 --> 00:42:54,050
I have important business with her.

621
00:42:54,770 --> 00:42:55,770
Let her go now.

622
00:43:07,970 --> 00:43:10,570
You haven't changed a bit, even after all this time.

623
00:43:10,990 --> 00:43:13,550
It's great to see you after such a long time.

624
00:43:14,470 --> 00:43:16,120
If you leave, it'll be a great...

625
00:43:21,250 --> 00:43:22,390
Let's go, Yeon-ji.

626
00:43:22,790 --> 00:43:23,790
Are you okay?

627
00:43:30,170 --> 00:43:31,170
Du-han!

628
00:43:32,230 --> 00:43:33,230
Kim Du-han!

629
00:44:13,450 --> 00:44:14,510
That's enough now.

630
00:44:15,170 --> 00:44:16,170
I'll be going.

631
00:44:16,350 --> 00:44:17,600
No, it's still dangerous.

632
00:44:17,770 --> 00:44:19,270
I'll take you to where I live.

633
00:44:19,450 --> 00:44:20,450
I'm fine.

634
00:44:27,630 --> 00:44:28,630
This neighborhood...

635
00:44:28,850 --> 00:44:29,970
It's more complicated than it looks.

636
00:44:30,010 --> 00:44:33,190
There are good people, and people from Namdaemun,
and even people from Wangsimni coming and going...

637
00:44:33,230 --> 00:44:34,490
Anyway, I'll take you to where I live.

638
00:44:34,530 --> 00:44:35,530
No.

639
00:44:36,110 --> 00:44:37,350
There's no need for that.

640
00:44:37,390 --> 00:44:38,940
I won't feel at ease otherwise.

641
00:44:41,650 --> 00:44:45,930
In that case, I'd like to buy you a cup of tea to show my gratitude.

642
00:44:46,950 --> 00:44:47,950
Do you like coffee?

643
00:44:48,730 --> 00:44:49,730
Yes.

644
00:45:34,700 --> 00:45:36,300
He passed away in Tokyo.

645
00:45:36,420 --> 00:45:37,420
Mr. Yi Sang.

646
00:45:39,460 --> 00:45:40,460
Yi Sang?

647
00:45:41,140 --> 00:45:42,740
That's a strange name.

648
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:46,440
He was a strange person, just like his name.

649
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:49,980
He was originally an architect, but he also wrote poetry, painted...

650
00:45:50,020 --> 00:45:52,170
He seems to have been a very talented poet.

651
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:53,880
A poet?

652
00:45:54,100 --> 00:45:54,380
Yes.

653
00:45:55,060 --> 00:45:55,600
Welcome.

654
00:45:55,640 --> 00:45:57,340
His poems are as unique as he was.

655
00:45:57,720 --> 00:46:01,770
They're a bit difficult, but if you keep
reading them, you start to understand...

656
00:46:02,700 --> 00:46:04,420
Do you like poetry?

657
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:05,580
Pardon?

658
00:46:06,260 --> 00:46:07,400
Yes.

659
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:15,200
Poetry...

660
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:30,740
That's a song I like.

661
00:46:43,080 --> 00:46:44,900
What song is it?

662
00:47:00,670 --> 00:47:02,170
"The Lonely Streetlight."

663
00:47:30,370 --> 00:47:33,170
I used to think I was a very special person.

664
00:47:34,430 --> 00:47:37,650
Sad and unfortunate things...

665
00:47:37,690 --> 00:47:41,070
I lived believing they would all avoid me.

666
00:47:41,550 --> 00:47:42,870
Until I was seventeen.

667
00:47:46,650 --> 00:47:48,230
But that wasn't the case.

668
00:47:50,830 --> 00:47:52,430
Misfortune struck suddenly.

669
00:47:54,450 --> 00:47:56,950
From the moment my father started playing mahjong.

670
00:47:57,450 --> 00:47:58,450
Mahjong...

671
00:47:58,690 --> 00:48:00,810
Gambling ruins everything.

672
00:48:03,950 --> 00:48:05,310
Our house...

673
00:48:05,350 --> 00:48:08,470
Our orchard, everything was lost...

674
00:48:08,510 --> 00:48:10,530
And he left for Manchuria.

675
00:48:13,910 --> 00:48:19,310
He sold all our cotton blankets in the winter...

676
00:48:19,350 --> 00:48:25,630
Seeing my younger siblings shivering all
night under the remaining thin blankets...

677
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,660
I thought I had to do something, anything.

678
00:48:33,829 --> 00:48:35,229
Anything...

679
00:48:38,390 --> 00:48:40,410
So you went to the Huian store...

680
00:48:58,860 --> 00:49:01,540
This time, I'll make sure you can hold on to the train.

681
00:49:01,580 --> 00:49:05,700
The pure spirit of the Great Japanese Empire commands the Korean will...

682
00:49:05,740 --> 00:49:06,740
Are you crazy?

683
00:49:06,860 --> 00:49:08,000
You're the crazy one.

684
00:49:12,360 --> 00:49:13,900
Can I visit you again?

685
00:49:15,260 --> 00:49:16,260
Pardon?

686
00:49:16,900 --> 00:49:18,160
Can I come see you again?

687
00:49:19,240 --> 00:49:20,240
Let's meet again.

688
00:49:23,800 --> 00:49:26,150
Didn't I tell you that you should never hit me?

689
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:31,530
I never thought the day would come when
I'd take off my clothes in front of you, sir.

690
00:49:32,093 --> 00:49:40,693
