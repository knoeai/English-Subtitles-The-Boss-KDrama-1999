2
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:29,840
Hey!

3
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:30,300
Get up!

4
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:31,720
Hey, you!

5
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:34,060
Anchovy!

6
00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:18,890
Don't just leave him.

7
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:19,650
Why?

8
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:21,970
We have to take Anchovy's body with us.

9
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:24,670
Anchovy!

10
00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:52,930
He's perfectly fine over here.

11
00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:55,010
Hey, Toe, you lost.

12
00:01:55,370 --> 00:01:56,450
Chunsam won.

13
00:01:56,570 --> 00:01:57,090
That's right!

14
00:01:57,570 --> 00:01:59,050
From now on, Anchovy is the Boss!

15
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:01,090
Hey!

16
00:02:03,410 --> 00:02:04,750
You have to leave the records behind!

17
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:08,130
You think you can hog all the feasts and funerals for yourself?

18
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:10,470
Hand it over when I'm asking nicely!

19
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:16,070
Says who? When I think of Rat Droppings, I could kill you.

20
00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:38,210
Parrot, you won't get away with this either!

21
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:41,630
You damn beggar bastards!

22
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:45,110
You think you can just live comfortably with your legs spread?

23
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:45,750
When?

24
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:46,670
When?

25
00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:49,030
You don't know when you'll become a pile of ash!

26
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:49,990
Toe!

27
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:53,090
You better live the rest of your life straight, you punk!

28
00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:58,090
If you ever step foot near our turf again, I'll snap your legs!

29
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:26,580
We've come a long way!

30
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,000
Look at these punks!

31
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,160
We haven't even finished the barley powder!

32
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:36,140
You can't find it, so get lost!

33
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:07,280
Oh my!

34
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:11,640
Even if he only eats rice, he can't eat meat and will just be a bag of bones!

35
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:13,240
Look at these punks!

36
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:15,860
His legs are going to get twisted!

37
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:22,620
You damn punks!

38
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:03,620
Stretch your hand out further.

39
00:05:06,810 --> 00:06:38,340
No, this won't do. Let's just go. No, he looks like my brother. Boss, what are you doing?

40
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:46,440
Just go. Don't touch them. Bury them properly.

41
00:06:51,970 --> 00:07:00,650
Let's just go. Why are the women next to you, punk? Should I mess with you because I'm scared?

42
00:07:02,010 --> 00:07:02,330
Brother!

43
00:07:02,730 --> 00:07:02,850
Brother!

44
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:05,630
What for?

45
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:06,990
Big brother!

46
00:07:07,410 --> 00:07:08,750
Big brother, come here, quick!

47
00:07:09,790 --> 00:07:11,050
Come here, quick!

48
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:27,760
Yeon-ji, let's go!

49
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:29,660
Let's go!

50
00:09:10,610 --> 00:09:12,010
This...

51
00:09:28,930 --> 00:09:31,930
Did you take this from those gangsters?

52
00:09:35,890 --> 00:09:37,290
Are you okay?

53
00:09:38,130 --> 00:09:38,830
Are you hurt?

54
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:45,500
Thanks.

55
00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:06,330
Yeon-ji, after you graduate, are you going to Tokyo to study dance?

56
00:10:06,810 --> 00:10:16,830
Yeah. If you come and they make me study something other than dance, there's only one thing I can do. What do you think that is?

57
00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:21,950
Jumping into the Hyeonhaetan Sea? Oh, who's going to believe that lie?

58
00:10:22,890 --> 00:10:30,310
My family doesn't have the money to send me for more studies. What am I going to do now?

59
00:10:55,220 --> 00:11:02,180
Here, eat this and go. Weren't you on your way to the bathroom?

60
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:10,710
Leave the bowl and go.

61
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,400
Idiot!

62
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:31,380
Idiot!

63
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:36,600
Some lady has been waiting for a while. She said she was your mom.

64
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:50,060
Chunsam,

65
00:11:55,810 --> 00:11:58,450
Do you recognize your mom, Chunsam?

66
00:12:01,530 --> 00:12:04,750
Ma'am, what's your last name?

67
00:12:05,570 --> 00:12:25,990
Park. The Miryang Park clan. I came to Daegu from Jangseong seven years ago. Do you know what my old house looked like? People called it the tile-roofed house. A stream flowed behind the house, and there were three persimmon trees in the yard. My... my child... who?

68
00:12:27,610 --> 00:12:30,290
Your... your older uncle is living there. Mother!

69
00:12:31,290 --> 00:12:32,470
Chunsam!

70
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:35,410
Chunsam!

71
00:12:39,710 --> 00:12:40,370
And your sister?

72
00:12:40,950 --> 00:12:43,450
What happened to your sister?

73
00:12:44,650 --> 00:12:48,640
I sent people to your grandmother's house in Jangseong several times. Mother...

74
00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:53,250
Your sister?

75
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:54,230
Your sister?

76
00:13:16,890 --> 00:13:19,250
I'm sorry. What is there to be sorry about?

77
00:13:19,830 --> 00:13:37,190
If the Boss leaves, I'll be the new Boss. You're lucky, Boss. Your mother looks like a rich lady. Boss, take me with you. If you take me, I'll eat less. This kid has no sense. Why would the Boss take a troublesome guy like you?

78
00:13:38,690 --> 00:13:59,230
Take care. Whether you can fill the kids' stomachs is up to the Boss. Parrot, you'll do well. Because you're the most skilled beggar in Daegu. I'm not coming back here ever again. I'm never coming back.

79
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:18,420
Oh, what's that smell? This stinky kid. Hold on. I'm going to adopt this kid. Samsun, you want to see your bathwater?

80
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:42,760
It's so clear, you could eat it as soup when you're hungry. Just watch your mouth. New lady, take your new son. I understand. My real son has finally returned. It's not shameful that you lived as a beggar. What could a child without parents do?

81
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:50,500
But from now on, you must not live like you used to. Understand?

82
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:57,040
Change your clothes, and let's go greet your father first.

83
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:24,860
I'm back from school. That's your brother. Nice to meet you. I wanted a little brother too. Ah, yes.

84
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:33,840
Nice to meet you. Oh, you must have suffered a lot.

85
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,040
You should bow to your father first.

86
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:55,140
A deep bow. That's right, Chunsam. When you bow to an adult, your forehead should touch the floor.

87
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:07,720
Chunsam, that's enough, that's enough. Why be so strict from the very beginning?

88
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:15,540
Manners are something you learn over time. Sit down, sit down.

89
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:32,520
How many meals have you skipped?

90
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:36,720
You must have starved a lot when you were a beggar, right?

91
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:38,220
How many days did you starve?

92
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:40,620
Well, about two or three days?

93
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:42,900
How did you feel after starving for two or three days?

94
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:44,000
You saw nothing, right?

95
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:56,860
Here's the thing. If you starve for two days, you'll eat rotten food. After a week, you'll even eat rats. And if it's more than six days, then...

96
00:16:56,860 --> 00:16:59,800
Then what happens if you starve for six days?

97
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:10,540
Vampires... Vampires that live by drinking human blood. That's how they're born. What's that?

98
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:28,300
You're ignorant. You'll learn it all in school. A long time ago in Europe, they punished criminals by locking them in caves and starving them to death. Eventually, they started eating each other, and a few became vampires.

99
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:36,360
You almost became a bloodsucking vampire. What a shame. Hello.

100
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:40,100
My name is Kim. Hello.

101
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:41,180
My name is...

102
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:45,360
Shall we try it one by one?

103
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:46,540
Hello.

104
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:53,040
My name is Song. Hello, Mr. Park.

105
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:58,880
My name is Mr. Park. Hello, Teacher Jeong.

106
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:07,140
My name is Teacher Jeong. Then, Mr. Kim, Mr. Kim, Teacher Kim Chun.

107
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:14,500
Mr. Kim, what's your name?

108
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:20,020
What's your name? Teacher Kim Chun.

109
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,160
Mr. Kim, how old are you?

110
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:34,140
Age... How old are you? Ten... ten... four... ten years old.

111
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:39,300
Uh, come in.

112
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:45,440
Is there a loud person in the house?

113
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:51,920
Does a loud person often come to your house?

114
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:54,960
Wow, are you curious?

115
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:57,460
Come here.

116
00:19:02,090 --> 00:19:12,110
There's a little person inside who sings. Liar. Even if he lies, his ears can't. Do you want to listen?

117
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:33,120
The voice is just like a person's. I was right, wasn't I?

118
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:41,800
I've only seen it once, but they say if you shake this box a lot, people even smaller than dwarves pop out. Do you want to try?

119
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:45,640
Hurry up and shake it.

120
00:19:49,790 --> 00:19:54,010
Harder, harder.

121
00:19:57,470 --> 00:20:06,690
Oh my, this... Oh my, what do I do? I'll try to fix it somehow. Fix it?

122
00:20:08,190 --> 00:20:10,870
Do you think there's a technician in all of Joseon who can fix this?

123
00:20:11,870 --> 00:20:18,550
My uncle bought this for me in Tokyo, a German product. Do I know about music? What do I know?

124
00:20:18,990 --> 00:20:24,250
I've lived my life just for the pleasure of listening to this one thing. Oh, it's a disaster.

125
00:20:30,370 --> 00:20:37,270
If you wanted to listen to it, you should have just asked. Your father treasures this so much. How could you touch it so carelessly?

126
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:45,030
That's enough. Go to your room.

127
00:20:50,130 --> 00:20:56,930
Mother, don't scold him too much. It's his first time seeing a phonograph, he must have been so curious.

128
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:25,890
Hey, Parrot!

129
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:32,710
It's you guys. What brings you all the way here?

130
00:21:32,930 --> 00:21:42,230
Where is a beggar not welcome? There are no invitations, no rules for begging, no need for requests. You guys are using fancy words?

131
00:21:42,730 --> 00:21:52,830
In our territory, there are two schools and four temples. A dog at a school for three years learns to recite poetry. We've picked up a few phrases while begging around the schools. How is it, not bad?

132
00:21:52,910 --> 00:22:00,810
Yeah, but the smell from the school's outhouse is really something. That's right, it's worse than a scholar's poop.

133
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:07,300
By the way, what's that smell?

134
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:11,500
Is that rice cakes?

135
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:26,840
What's going on?

136
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:28,560
The Ulsan lady!

137
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,080
The Ulsan lady!

138
00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:43,200
Scrape everything out of the cauldron, even the burnt rice. What's going on?

139
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:44,200
Why are you pulling?

140
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:45,360
Why are you so stingy?

141
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:49,880
Jun-seo!

142
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:50,980
Jun-seo!

143
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:08,400
Are you okay?

144
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:10,020
It's okay.

145
00:23:17,850 --> 00:23:19,240
Such a small kid, but so fearless.

146
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:37,090
Thank you. That's enough. How was it?

147
00:23:37,870 --> 00:23:40,310
With this, we can take on those Japanese guys, right?

148
00:23:40,670 --> 00:23:47,750
Hmm, hmm, hmm. Well, you passed the test. Well done. Hey, Jin-seong!

149
00:23:47,790 --> 00:23:48,730
Aren't you going to listen to me?

150
00:23:48,730 --> 00:24:17,730
Hey, I've got a fight with a Japanese guy at the cathedral. If you win, I'll give you half of my winnings. Don't want it. If you win this time, you'll be my guard. And I'll introduce you to some famous gangsters in the city. Didn't I tell you to wash up? Where's the soap?

151
00:24:17,910 --> 00:24:21,150
Just because I took in a dirty beggar, washed him, and clothed him, do you think you can do whatever you want?

152
00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:22,330
Huh?

153
00:24:22,610 --> 00:24:22,610
Huh?

154
00:24:23,050 --> 00:24:36,410
Look at this guy. How dare he glare at me like that? Hey, you're just a parasite living off someone else's family, aren't you? Aren't you going to listen to me?

155
00:24:38,330 --> 00:24:46,270
If you don't listen to me, from now on, you and your mother won't get a single drop of soup in this house. You got that? Hey, you!

156
00:24:46,270 --> 00:24:46,850
Do you want to die?

157
00:24:47,030 --> 00:24:50,490
Why are you insulting my mom, you bastard! You gangster!

158
00:24:50,510 --> 00:24:51,190
What are you doing?

159
00:24:51,530 --> 00:24:51,950
Do you want to die?

160
00:24:52,750 --> 00:24:53,350
You gangsters, stop it!

161
00:24:53,630 --> 00:24:55,510
Hey, aren't you going to get lost, you punk!

162
00:24:55,810 --> 00:24:58,890
Aren't you going to get lost? Is the Boss at home right now?

163
00:24:59,290 --> 00:25:04,490
He should be. He's back from school. But if Toe finds out we snitched on him to the Boss, he won't let it slide, right?

164
00:25:04,870 --> 00:25:14,310
He definitely won't let it slide. Then there's no choice. Whether we tell on him or do him a favor, we'll get ripped off either way. This is it. Oh my.

165
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:27,340
I don't see the Boss, only a delicious rice ball. Hey, you punk!

166
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:28,840
What are you trying to steal?

167
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,500
You beggar kids! Hey, you punk!

168
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:33,900
You frog, you're alone?

169
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:34,420
What do we do?

170
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:37,200
You punk, let's go! You damn punk!

171
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:37,720
What's wrong?

172
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:46,540
You're scared now, you punk! No, I just need to meet the Boss. These beggar kids are loitering around, you punk!

173
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:50,480
Stop hitting him!

174
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:52,560
We came to see the Boss, why are you hitting us?

175
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:55,720
Stop hitting him!

176
00:25:57,580 --> 00:26:03,740
That's enough. Aren't you going to get lost, you punk?

177
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:21,000
Dong-min! Dong-min, how did this happen?

178
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:23,200
Who did this?

179
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:27,040
You're the Boss, Chunsam, right?

180
00:26:30,210 --> 00:26:41,450
Chunsam must be different because he's a beggar king. His mother must be happy. You just show off your strength to your older brother. Yes, well done.

181
00:26:54,130 --> 00:26:55,650
Where are you coming from?

182
00:26:56,570 --> 00:26:58,550
I asked where you're coming from.

183
00:27:00,390 --> 00:27:03,110
Did you do something so bad you can't even tell your mother?

184
00:27:04,810 --> 00:27:06,170
Did you bring that child here?

185
00:27:08,410 --> 00:27:09,090
No, right?

186
00:27:11,350 --> 00:27:19,230
Chunsam, you promised me you wouldn't meet those kids again. This has nothing to do with you, right?

187
00:27:20,670 --> 00:27:24,970
Yes, that child must have just wandered in to steal something. Right?

188
00:27:26,730 --> 00:27:35,190
He came because of me. I told him it was okay to meet me. He...

189
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:47,240
Please let him go. I'll let the child go. Come in here.

190
00:27:55,040 --> 00:28:02,600
Hurry up and go. Frog is waiting. Boss, I'm going to see Toe tomorrow. I'm dead.

191
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:35,800
Chunsam, I told you so many times not to associate with those beggar children. Abandoning a child once already drove a nail into this mother's heart. Not again. Never again. Is anyone out there?

192
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:42,080
Lock this child in the storeroom. Don't let him go anywhere until I say so.

193
00:29:13,410 --> 00:29:14,710
Chunsam, are you asleep?

194
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:23,740
Your mother has sinned greatly.

195
00:29:27,810 --> 00:29:37,850
I'm sorry for my many sins. How could I hit you? How could I hit the child I finally found?

196
00:29:42,510 --> 00:29:56,530
Because of a mere two bags of rice, I left my two children behind to remarry. But not a single day passed when I didn't think of you and your sister.

197
00:30:01,190 --> 00:30:02,990
Your poor sister.

198
00:30:06,190 --> 00:30:11,710
Your poor sister became food for beasts in the forest.

199
00:30:16,570 --> 00:30:23,350
I'm the one who deserves to die. If only I hadn't abandoned you two.

200
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:36,120
Yes, maybe it would be more comfortable to just live with you.

201
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:41,340
For you, what wouldn't I do, even if it meant selling my labor?

202
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:48,920
What's the use of sleeping under silk blankets if your heart is not at peace?

203
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:58,920
Yes, before it's too late, let's try to live together, just the two of us.

204
00:31:13,330 --> 00:31:16,730
I've boiled some tangerine and ginger tea for you.

205
00:31:17,910 --> 00:31:22,350
Drink it to warm yourself up and go to sleep.

206
00:32:14,630 --> 00:32:18,470
Mother, please forgive me.

207
00:33:02,250 --> 00:33:03,570
What happened?

208
00:33:04,470 --> 00:33:06,090
What happened to you guys?

209
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:11,680
He might die.

210
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:12,600
Let me see.

211
00:33:13,220 --> 00:33:14,360
Where's Parrot?

212
00:33:17,310 --> 00:33:19,530
I asked where Parrot is!

213
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:32,080
Parrot!

214
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:33,760
Where's Parrot, you punk!

215
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:26,220
Anchovy, you!

216
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:33,140
My eye!

217
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:37,640
Anchovy!

218
00:34:47,060 --> 00:34:48,540
Anchovy, my eye!

219
00:34:56,310 --> 00:34:56,970
Are you okay?

220
00:34:57,450 --> 00:34:58,470
You're not hurt badly?

221
00:34:58,670 --> 00:34:59,650
Look, your teeth.

222
00:34:59,870 --> 00:35:00,450
Don't worry.

223
00:35:00,870 --> 00:35:02,750
I've never seen anyone die from eating with one hand.

224
00:35:03,330 --> 00:35:03,890
That's a relief.

225
00:35:04,910 --> 00:35:05,570
Boss!

226
00:35:08,930 --> 00:35:09,910
Parrot, listen up.

227
00:35:11,330 --> 00:35:13,710
From now on, you have to take good care of the kids.

228
00:35:14,410 --> 00:35:14,730
What about you?

229
00:35:14,730 --> 00:35:18,170
I'm going to Gyeongseong.

230
00:35:18,470 --> 00:35:19,190
Gyeongseong?

231
00:35:20,710 --> 00:35:21,850
What about your mother?

232
00:35:22,750 --> 00:35:23,830
I ran away from home.

233
00:35:24,590 --> 00:35:27,710
Even if I have to beg, I'm going to live in the big city. Got it?

234
00:35:28,410 --> 00:35:30,290
Yeah, good thinking.

235
00:35:31,130 --> 00:35:32,210
I'll go with you.

236
00:35:32,730 --> 00:35:34,050
No, you stay here.

237
00:35:37,230 --> 00:35:38,030
Take care, Parrot.

238
00:35:42,410 --> 00:35:43,210
Boss!

239
00:35:44,090 --> 00:35:45,530
Where are you going again?

240
00:35:47,250 --> 00:35:48,150
Where are you going?

241
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:50,330
Let's go together.

242
00:35:51,530 --> 00:35:52,850
Parrot, you can't go.

243
00:35:53,650 --> 00:35:55,150
I'm originally from Gyeongseong.

244
00:35:55,850 --> 00:35:57,310
You don't know the area well.

245
00:35:57,830 --> 00:35:59,870
Gyeongseong is so complicated and scary.

246
00:36:01,030 --> 00:36:04,230
Don't worry and just take care of the kids.

247
00:36:12,910 --> 00:36:13,670
Don't follow me.

248
00:36:14,450 --> 00:36:15,090
Don't follow me.

249
00:36:18,580 --> 00:36:19,880
I said don't follow me.

250
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:22,120
I said don't follow me!

251
00:36:39,860 --> 00:36:41,880
Boss, when are you coming back?

252
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:39,220
You guys... are you trying to die, you punks!

253
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,360
You don't even know the Meiji Bridge is melting.

254
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:55,460
The chrysanthemum bread from Bukmidang has long since gone cold.

255
00:37:56,260 --> 00:38:00,140
It's the talk of the town, where one of two could drown in tears and no one would know.

256
00:38:00,140 --> 00:38:02,640
Director Lee Gyu-won's "The Tree"...

257
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:05,960
When will he come if he takes the ferry?

258
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:07,900
No, when will he come if he goes?

259
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:08,660
Don't follow me.

260
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:09,600
Hey, Yeong-deok.

261
00:38:12,380 --> 00:38:13,800
What happened to getting the free tickets?

262
00:38:14,020 --> 00:38:15,360
I'll definitely get them next time.

263
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:18,480
You're supposed to be good at getting hit, and you can't even get that?

264
00:38:23,970 --> 00:38:25,430
Cheon-seong, we don't need to get involved.

265
00:38:29,230 --> 00:38:31,250
Hey, you're hitting a kid, you bastard.

266
00:38:32,470 --> 00:38:34,630
Run, run, run.

267
00:38:39,110 --> 00:38:41,730
Hey, Su-dam, run!

268
00:38:41,870 --> 00:38:42,410
Hey, hurry!

269
00:38:56,190 --> 00:38:57,310
Ah, I almost died.

270
00:39:02,610 --> 00:39:04,030
What's... what's this?

271
00:39:04,850 --> 00:39:05,590
It's from the warehouse.

272
00:39:06,170 --> 00:39:07,850
Ah, from the warehouse.

273
00:39:08,750 --> 00:39:09,590
How did you get it?

274
00:39:10,570 --> 00:39:12,290
Even ordinary people can't get a look at this.

275
00:39:13,510 --> 00:39:15,730
You're making such a fuss over something that looks like a pumpkin seed?

276
00:39:16,450 --> 00:39:19,210
If it weren't for our Boss today, you would have been killed by those guys.

277
00:39:19,910 --> 00:39:20,810
Don't you talk.

278
00:39:20,990 --> 00:39:24,950
Among my friends, there's a guy who can take down not just three, but four guys at once.

279
00:39:25,890 --> 00:39:27,210
Gyeongseong folks really brag a lot.

280
00:39:27,430 --> 00:39:27,970
Now you know, right?

281
00:39:29,350 --> 00:39:29,910
It's true.

282
00:39:29,910 --> 00:39:35,030
He's Kim Du-han, a guy who sells fish-shaped bread in our country. He even won a fight against a gangster when he was a kid.

283
00:39:37,190 --> 00:39:38,610
Come here, come here.

284
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:57,860
This, this, this punk.

285
00:39:57,860 --> 00:40:00,500
Come here, come here, come here.

286
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:02,220
No, we didn't do it.

287
00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:03,980
Some other beggar kids did it.

288
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:05,100
It wasn't us.

289
00:40:05,300 --> 00:40:06,420
Where are these other beggar kids?

290
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:08,120
Hey, you beggar punks.

291
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:10,140
You're always stealing, you bastards.

292
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:13,340
Just leave him alone.

293
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:14,080
He didn't do anything wrong.

294
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:15,620
Shut up, you punk.

295
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:17,000
You stay out of it and get lost.

296
00:40:17,820 --> 00:40:18,980
Won't you let go of my arm, punk?

297
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:19,480
Scram.

298
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:20,880
Scram.

299
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:22,440
This punk.

300
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:25,220
Now they've added seasoning to the noodle dough.

301
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:26,320
They added seasoning.

302
00:40:27,290 --> 00:40:27,940
Hey, you punk.

303
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:28,540
Stop right there!

304
00:40:29,020 --> 00:40:29,800
Stop there!

305
00:40:30,460 --> 00:40:31,320
Hey, you beggar punks.

306
00:40:47,460 --> 00:40:48,660
Hey, thanks.

307
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:51,260
You're the first person I've met who's faster than me.

308
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:54,760
What's your name?

309
00:40:56,180 --> 00:40:56,840
Deong-chi.

310
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:58,280
My real name is Kim Du-han.

311
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:02,500
The beggars in Gyeongseong are quick-witted.

312
00:41:03,220 --> 00:41:04,220
And they brag a lot.

313
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:06,240
The kids from Gyeongseong only talk big.

314
00:41:06,820 --> 00:41:08,020
They're scared and have no grit.

315
00:41:08,020 --> 00:41:08,380
That's right.

316
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:12,440
I used to live at Supyogyo, but the Boss is too old.

317
00:41:13,060 --> 00:41:17,740
The Gwanggyo area is tough because of the troublemakers. I think Yeomcheon Bridge will be the easiest.

318
00:41:18,180 --> 00:41:18,420
Yeah.

319
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:21,040
The Yeomcheon Bridge Boss seems like he's all talk and no guts.

320
00:41:21,940 --> 00:41:23,340
I was aiming for that place from the start.

321
00:41:23,580 --> 00:41:25,340
You have to crush the spirit of the Gyeongseong kids right from the start.

322
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:29,440
If you show them you're stronger than their Boss, they'll all come over to your side right away.

323
00:41:30,980 --> 00:41:31,660
Good luck.

324
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:33,900
If you need my fists, come to Umigwan anytime.

325
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:35,960
Take care.

326
00:41:36,140 --> 00:41:36,540
Hey guys.

327
00:41:36,540 --> 00:41:39,240
They say eating this will make you really strong.

328
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:41,600
The beekeeper's father at Tapgol Park said so.

329
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:42,880
He really said that.

330
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:46,380
I'm already strong without eating this stuff.

331
00:41:47,140 --> 00:41:47,500
Hey.

332
00:41:47,820 --> 00:41:48,980
It's good to be stronger.

333
00:41:49,260 --> 00:41:50,460
Then no one can hit you.

334
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:51,060
Right.

335
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:52,420
There's poison in this stinger.

336
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,580
The strength comes from the stinger.

337
00:41:55,420 --> 00:41:56,680
The beekeeper's father said so.

338
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:59,380
He said Xiang Yu became a great general after eating a hundred of these bees.

339
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:00,500
Hurry up and eat.

340
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:00,940
Boss.

341
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:01,620
No.

342
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:02,780
Hurry up and eat.

343
00:42:03,060 --> 00:42:03,480
Boss.

344
00:42:04,060 --> 00:42:04,260
Hey.

345
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:05,520
Who's the Boss here?

346
00:42:06,180 --> 00:42:07,220
Who are you?

347
00:42:08,620 --> 00:42:09,500
Anchovy from Daegu.

348
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:11,660
From now on, I'm going to live here.

349
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:12,520
What?

350
00:42:13,020 --> 00:42:15,540
We're already living here. How can you live here too?

351
00:42:15,740 --> 00:42:16,280
Are you crazy?

352
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:16,680
Really.

353
00:42:20,310 --> 00:42:21,590
You guys just have to become my underlings.

354
00:42:21,950 --> 00:42:23,290
You want to be my underlings?

355
00:42:23,670 --> 00:42:24,110
No.

356
00:42:24,310 --> 00:42:25,210
You said it backwards.

357
00:42:25,710 --> 00:42:27,090
Are you opposing me right now?

358
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:42,500
Here.

359
00:42:43,420 --> 00:42:44,800
Chunsam, Du-han, what are you doing?

360
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:45,420
Hurry up.

361
00:42:46,740 --> 00:42:47,560
What's this?

362
00:42:48,700 --> 00:42:49,800
Hurry up and eat.

363
00:42:50,380 --> 00:42:50,600
Hey.

364
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:51,880
It's just like you, hyungdo.

365
00:42:52,220 --> 00:42:53,280
You've come to feed us.

366
00:42:53,560 --> 00:42:53,980
Du-han.

367
00:42:54,020 --> 00:42:55,200
Your fists protected us.

368
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:58,740
Did you hear about Chunsam beating up the forest kids yesterday?

369
00:42:59,420 --> 00:43:00,040
Yeah.

370
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:00,740
Really?

371
00:43:05,810 --> 00:43:06,430
Teacher.

372
00:43:06,650 --> 00:43:07,290
Did you enjoy the movie?

373
00:43:20,740 --> 00:43:21,840
Excuse me.

374
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:23,340
Excuse me, sir.

375
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:24,520
Sir.

376
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:25,780
Excuse me, sir.

377
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:26,940
Yeon-ju.

378
00:43:27,300 --> 00:43:28,000
Yeon-ju.

379
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:29,600
Excuse me.

380
00:43:30,260 --> 00:43:31,360
Excuse me.

381
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:32,460
Sir.

382
00:44:13,410 --> 00:44:14,510
Move.

383
00:44:14,990 --> 00:44:14,990
Move.

384
00:44:15,350 --> 00:44:16,090
Help me.

385
00:44:28,060 --> 00:44:28,600
Get him.

386
00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:29,800
You bastard.

387
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:30,140
Move.

388
00:44:51,790 --> 00:44:52,390
I'm sorry.

389
00:44:52,850 --> 00:44:54,250
Should I just kill you?

390
00:44:54,850 --> 00:44:56,850
You damn thief.

391
00:44:59,450 --> 00:45:01,710
I didn't mean to steal it, why are you doing this?

392
00:45:02,210 --> 00:45:03,110
Do you know how much this is worth?

393
00:45:03,570 --> 00:45:04,310
This punk.

394
00:45:04,310 --> 00:45:06,730
Really, sir, it came out with the expensive stuff.

395
00:45:08,310 --> 00:45:09,710
A ten-won item. I'm sorry.

396
00:45:09,870 --> 00:45:12,130
I only have a thousand won, this bastard.

397
00:45:12,390 --> 00:45:14,270
I really didn't mean to.

398
00:45:14,750 --> 00:45:15,690
My hand just... without me knowing.

399
00:45:21,450 --> 00:45:22,850
I'm really sorry.

400
00:45:29,490 --> 00:45:30,190
I'm sorry.

401
00:45:30,550 --> 00:45:31,370
You bastard.

402
00:45:31,870 --> 00:45:32,570
I'm sorry.

403
00:45:36,350 --> 00:45:37,970
Why are you stealing other people's things?

404
00:45:38,010 --> 00:45:38,670
It's because of my hand.

405
00:45:39,290 --> 00:45:40,230
It's because of my hand.

406
00:45:42,050 --> 00:45:44,850
You bastard.

407
00:45:44,930 --> 00:45:45,670
It's because of my hand.

408
00:45:45,810 --> 00:45:47,710
You keep stealing other people's things because of your hand.

409
00:45:48,660 --> 00:45:50,550
You had no intention, but your hand stole it on its own.

410
00:45:50,550 --> 00:45:50,930
Right?

411
00:45:51,130 --> 00:45:51,490
Right?

412
00:45:51,590 --> 00:45:52,250
It's because of this hand.

413
00:45:52,450 --> 00:45:52,950
You bastard.

414
00:45:53,410 --> 00:45:54,410
It's because of this hand.

415
00:45:55,530 --> 00:45:56,370
It was the hand's fault.

416
00:45:56,470 --> 00:45:57,190
The hand did it on its own.

417
00:45:57,310 --> 00:45:57,830
You bastard.

418
00:46:08,090 --> 00:46:09,090
Keep an eye on your hand.

419
00:46:10,130 --> 00:46:12,190
Trusting the five won you earn with your hand,

420
00:46:12,410 --> 00:46:13,850
our kids in the shack are starving.

421
00:46:14,370 --> 00:46:16,630
Because of you, ten beggars might starve to death.

422
00:46:16,730 --> 00:46:16,950
Got it?

423
00:46:26,130 --> 00:46:27,050
Hey, Hyeongdo.

424
00:46:28,270 --> 00:46:29,090
Don't cry, man.

425
00:46:31,590 --> 00:46:34,510
Don't you ever lay a hand on my kids again without my permission.

426
00:46:34,550 --> 00:46:34,830
Got it?

427
00:46:36,590 --> 00:46:37,190
Fine.

428
00:46:38,410 --> 00:46:41,610
But don't ever ask me to make him a thief again.

429
00:46:43,410 --> 00:46:44,630
I'll send you a well-behaved one.

430
00:46:45,610 --> 00:46:46,090
Forget it.

431
00:46:46,870 --> 00:46:48,290
You might as well entrust a fish to a cat.

432
00:46:48,570 --> 00:46:50,230
Hey, my kids don't steal.

433
00:46:50,370 --> 00:46:51,650
You know that one is a bit special.

434
00:46:52,290 --> 00:46:52,670
Please.

435
00:46:52,830 --> 00:46:53,630
Just take one less mouth to feed.

436
00:46:57,820 --> 00:46:58,420
Send him over.

437
00:47:01,300 --> 00:47:01,900
Are you okay?

438
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:04,040
I'm okay, Boss.

439
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:05,760
Is being okay enough, man?

440
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:07,520
I hit him to bring him to his senses.

441
00:47:08,180 --> 00:47:08,860
Wipe it.

442
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:15,200
Hey, this is called beauty water.

443
00:47:16,140 --> 00:47:19,760
I'll give you the address, and you just have your guys deliver it.

444
00:47:20,940 --> 00:47:23,580
Hey, I should have my kids wash up before sending them.

445
00:47:24,140 --> 00:47:28,080
It's cosmetics, after all. If smelly beggars deliver it, it'll ruin the image.

446
00:47:29,080 --> 00:47:30,520
You have to do it after business hours.

447
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:31,500
You're really reciting poetry.

448
00:47:31,500 --> 00:47:33,120
Hey, you punk.

449
00:47:33,180 --> 00:47:34,860
Do you even know what that is, wiping it like a rag?

450
00:47:35,500 --> 00:47:36,780
Isn't it something to eat?

451
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:38,220
It is something to eat, man.

452
00:47:38,920 --> 00:47:40,900
They're 50 jeon each. What if you burst them?

453
00:47:42,320 --> 00:47:44,040
You think just anyone can eat tangerines?

454
00:47:45,300 --> 00:47:49,280
This is so precious that King Sejong himself gave it as a prize at his first banquet.

455
00:47:49,660 --> 00:47:50,420
It's very precious.

456
00:47:50,500 --> 00:47:51,140
Don't even touch it.

457
00:47:51,780 --> 00:47:52,320
Wipe the window.

458
00:47:52,360 --> 00:47:53,540
Is it Anchovy from Yeomcheon Bridge?

459
00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:04,220
You've expanded your territory all the way to Seodaemun Yeongcheon, has your stomach gotten that big?

460
00:48:06,540 --> 00:48:10,560
If the number of mouths has increased, shouldn't the taxes increase automatically?

461
00:48:13,100 --> 00:48:16,760
Don't you know that taxes increase with the number of heads?

462
00:48:16,900 --> 00:48:18,140
We'll try to increase it gradually.

463
00:48:18,340 --> 00:48:22,340
Right now, we're in a tough spot just trying to get the cobwebs out of our kids' throats.

464
00:48:24,500 --> 00:48:26,700
Do you know why you got hit?

465
00:48:35,330 --> 00:48:38,410
I just don't like the look in this punk's eyes.

466
00:48:39,150 --> 00:48:45,150
When you look at me with those eyes, smiling like that, my insides twist like a fried dough stick, you bastard.

467
00:48:46,970 --> 00:48:47,930
Are you smiling?

468
00:48:48,490 --> 00:48:49,010
Are you smiling?

469
00:48:58,960 --> 00:48:59,440
Don't smile.

470
00:48:59,600 --> 00:49:00,140
Don't smile.

471
00:49:10,340 --> 00:49:14,260
You need to learn to lower your eyes in front of an adult.

472
00:49:18,780 --> 00:49:19,420
What?

473
00:49:22,620 --> 00:49:27,720
Don't worry about other people's eyes. Just keep an eye on your own hands.

474
00:49:28,520 --> 00:49:28,840
Get lost.

475
00:49:30,260 --> 00:49:31,980
Why are you getting involved with beggars?

476
