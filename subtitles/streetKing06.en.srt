2
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:03,810
That's enough now.

3
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,400
Sir...

4
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:18,200
I'm sorry.

5
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:19,820
Sir...

6
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:21,840
You foolish man...

7
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,440
That's not something the winner should say, you punk.

8
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:40,900
Not just anyone can raise a tiger cub like that.

9
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:53,420
Hey, let's gather the guys tonight for a drink.

10
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:56,660
We need to let people know who the new master of Jongno is, right?

11
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:57,060
Cheers!

12
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,000
Hey, Seung-hwan!

13
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:06,640
Sing us something exciting.

14
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,940
I'm honored to be here today.

15
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:13,960
I'd like to dedicate a song to Du-han, the new master of Jongno.

16
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:22,470
Man, I feel great today.

17
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:27,750
Even after all the countless days we've spent together, I've never felt as good as I do today.

18
00:02:28,130 --> 00:02:30,350
There's no need to be that happy.

19
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:33,530
The best victory is one won without fighting, and we couldn't do that.

20
00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:36,550
Double-Blade isn't the type to back down without a fight.

21
00:02:37,570 --> 00:02:41,350
If the three of us stick together, what is there that we can't do in this land of Joseon?

22
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:42,890
Du-han has the fists.

23
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:45,090
Chunsam has the guts.

24
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:46,810
And I have this, right here.

25
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:49,790
Let's make something big happen.

26
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:50,690
What big thing?

27
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:55,810
I don't know what we'll do, but let's just say we'll be rolling in money.

28
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:57,230
Don't be so obsessed with money.

29
00:02:57,430 --> 00:02:59,890
Having no money is a problem, but having too much is also a problem.

30
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:02,310
If we earn enough to cause problems, we can just give it to those who don't have any.

31
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:04,810
If you have a lot of money, you're human.

32
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:07,250
Not a human, you become a pig. A pig.

33
00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:09,210
I want to be a pig.

34
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:10,510
I want to be a pig.

35
00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:11,570
I have no education.

36
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:12,330
No family background.

37
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:14,150
So what else is there to gain respect besides money?

38
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:15,190
Hey, hey, don't bring up money.

39
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:17,530
Do you guys know what the best thing in the world is?

40
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:21,230
The best thing in the world...

41
00:03:23,210 --> 00:03:25,210
...is to love, and to be free.

42
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:27,530
Hey, you ignorant fools.

43
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:28,290
Have you ever heard of it?

44
00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:29,730
Love, freedom.

45
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:31,270
Have you done it?

46
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:31,750
Have you done it?

47
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:34,350
Chunsam must be very drunk.

48
00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:37,930
Hey, hey, where are you going?

49
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:49,240
What's going to happen to Double-Blade now?

50
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,300
What do you mean, what?

51
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:55,140
Have you ever seen a fallen raindrop rise back up to the sky?

52
00:03:56,660 --> 00:03:57,620
Anchovy!

53
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:02,840
It's been a long time since I've called you by that name.

54
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:11,180
When I saw you at the theater last time, I was so out of it I didn't even say hello.

55
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,600
Why are you here?

56
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:14,700
Oh, what brings you here?

57
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:29,000
Seeing you makes the fire that had set in the west rise up again, but that's all in the past.

58
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:32,920
I'm now...

59
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:34,680
...like a swallow with a broken leg.

60
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:44,200
With Kim Du-han standing tall in the middle of Gyeongseong, what power do I have to fart in front of a dung cart?

61
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,340
Let's get along well.

62
00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:51,970
Do you know what this is?

63
00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:54,070
What coin is it?

64
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:59,650
This is what Rat Droppings was holding in his hand until the very end.

65
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:01,950
Hoping to live well with his mother later.

66
00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:04,690
Instead.

67
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:13,500
My wish is that no one else in this world dies like Rat Droppings, but for that to happen, a guy like you has to disappear first.

68
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:20,470
It's a shame.

69
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:23,090
Next time we meet...

70
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:26,530
...let's not part on such a sour note.

71
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:30,650
Let's have a good, hard fight until our bones are crushed.

72
00:05:35,570 --> 00:05:36,850
A really hard one.

73
00:05:38,030 --> 00:05:39,050
Young master.

74
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:42,130
I think there's a story about you in here.

75
00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:43,830
What do these characters say?

76
00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:45,090
There are too many Chinese characters.

77
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:58,290
One of the two assassins who attempted to assassinate Governor-General Endo committed suicide during interrogation and was taken to the hospital, but died.

78
00:05:58,810 --> 00:05:59,670
Oh my goodness.

79
00:05:59,790 --> 00:06:01,030
Fate is in the hands of heaven.

80
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:02,870
Heaven is so heartless.

81
00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:08,050
Young master!

82
00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:08,970
Young master!

83
00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:11,210
Young master, you can't go outside!

84
00:06:11,650 --> 00:06:12,330
Young master!

85
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:15,790
Young master!

86
00:06:22,890 --> 00:06:25,990
Young master, you must be strong.

87
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:29,290
Think of Lee Han-young as gone from this world.

88
00:06:29,530 --> 00:06:30,510
Lee Han-young is dead.

89
00:06:31,650 --> 00:06:33,730
Think only of Kim Gwa-man of Yeongcheon-gun as being alive.

90
00:06:45,890 --> 00:06:46,310
Sit down.

91
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:02,180
Didn't I tell you not to beg anymore?

92
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,240
Have you been drinking?

93
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:06,000
How much did you make today playing the cripple?

94
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,140
3 won and 30 jeon.

95
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:10,200
Where is it?

96
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:15,100
2 won and 30 jeon are in the pot from when we split the money earlier.

97
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:15,760
And the rest?

98
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:19,220
The rest, you bastard!

99
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:21,240
What's the big deal if I spend it anywhere?

100
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:22,780
It's my money, after all.

101
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:30,100
I didn't hit anyone, I didn't steal anyone's money. What's wrong with begging?

102
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:40,500
Even if you can earn money, begging is the same as stealing, you bastard.

103
00:07:43,410 --> 00:07:46,630
It's like stealing someone's conscience from their pocket with an invisible hand, you punk.

104
00:07:47,850 --> 00:07:51,330
It's like stealing someone's conscience from their pocket with an invisible hand, you punk.

105
00:07:54,970 --> 00:07:55,830
Are you avoiding me?

106
00:07:56,210 --> 00:07:56,950
This bastard!

107
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,030
You're sleeping outside today.

108
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:01,710
It's still cold!

109
00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:02,890
That's why you're being punished!

110
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:04,190
That woman!

111
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:08,830
Just as my sister is crazy about the Boss, are you crazy about that woman?

112
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:16,870
So you're so crazy about that woman that you don't care if my toes get frostbitten and fall off?

113
00:08:59,930 --> 00:09:03,390
I'm sure it was Chuseok last year, but my heart is already...

114
00:09:05,330 --> 00:09:06,870
You slept with your punishment, didn't you?

115
00:09:08,410 --> 00:09:09,230
What did you do wrong?

116
00:09:12,830 --> 00:09:17,410
Yesterday, I was caught by the Boss while begging in front of Pungmidang.

117
00:09:18,330 --> 00:09:21,250
You idiot, the Boss told you not to beg anymore.

118
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:23,530
I did it because I need money.

119
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:25,530
Why do you need money?

120
00:09:25,610 --> 00:09:27,590
The Boss takes care of our food and clothes.

121
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:32,090
Sis, you're so crazy about the Boss that you don't even see me as a flea anymore, right?

122
00:09:32,930 --> 00:09:34,870
Where's a flea as big as you?

123
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:37,790
Whether you're a bedbug or a flea, you're my brother.

124
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:40,150
I'll make a mess of anyone who messes with my brother.

125
00:09:41,010 --> 00:09:45,730
No matter how much you talk big, sis, it's all for nothing.

126
00:09:46,810 --> 00:09:48,650
What do you know, you're just a kid.

127
00:09:49,210 --> 00:09:50,350
The Boss is a man too.

128
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:53,930
When a woman wags her tail, all men fall for it.

129
00:09:55,330 --> 00:09:55,710
A woman?

130
00:09:55,710 --> 00:10:00,930
To other guys, I might look like a tomboy, but the Boss sees me as a woman.

131
00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:01,710
He said so back then.

132
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:03,030
He asked if it was okay for a girl to steal.

133
00:10:09,330 --> 00:10:09,750
Here.

134
00:10:15,090 --> 00:10:18,090
Did you buy this with the money you begged for?

135
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:18,810
Yeah.

136
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:21,490
I need money sometimes too.

137
00:10:22,090 --> 00:10:22,550
Oh, really.

138
00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:25,570
Why are you doing something I didn't ask you to do?

139
00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:32,070
Hey, I think this was made wrong.

140
00:10:32,770 --> 00:10:34,170
Why are you so ugly?

141
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:34,750
Huh?

142
00:10:36,070 --> 00:10:36,210
Huh?

143
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:39,270
Sis, you should become a gisaeng too.

144
00:10:41,570 --> 00:10:43,210
Gisaengs are all so pretty.

145
00:10:44,050 --> 00:10:46,990
If you become a gisaeng, maybe the Boss will fall for you.

146
00:10:49,770 --> 00:10:50,370
Ah,

147
00:10:58,100 --> 00:10:59,620
I've been looking for you all morning.

148
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:00,940
Hey, did you feed the kids?

149
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:04,000
Ma'am, another bowl of soup here.

150
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:04,860
Oh, that's okay.

151
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:05,120
Ma'am.

152
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,920
If I eat something greasy, I'll just upset my stomach.

153
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:13,420
Hey, it feels like a hornet is buzzing around inside my head.

154
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,960
This is no time to be drinking.

155
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:23,320
What I hate more than rich misers are the guys who make liquor.

156
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:26,580
Try making rice with the rice they use to make liquor.

157
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:30,500
No headache, no stomach ache, a full belly, how great is that?

158
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:33,840
Just because we're poor, we don't have to hate the rich.

159
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:34,900
How great is it?

160
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:36,660
You can eat and drink.

161
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:38,680
I told you, this is not the time for drinking.

162
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:43,880
The Boss stopped the kids from begging, so now it's too hard to make a living.

163
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:46,280
You have to know how to endure hard times.

164
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:50,680
We can't survive this winter on just radish green porridge.

165
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:53,300
Hey, there were times when we couldn't even eat radish green porridge.

166
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:54,480
Think about the old days.

167
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,780
The old days were the old days, and now is now.

168
00:11:56,780 --> 00:12:04,050
Because of those Japanese bastards making a fuss about requisitioning, the restaurant's leftover bins are half empty, and it's hard to even get a glimpse of fat from the Yukgaegwan.

169
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:07,540
Some kids are even running away.

170
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:11,120
The other day, that Beetle kid got caught stealing rice cakes from the market.

171
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:11,420
What?

172
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:13,050
Beetle?

173
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:19,440
No, he didn't steal it, he was about to...

174
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,240
Anyway, if we keep going like this, something bad is going to happen.

175
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:22,400
We either have to start begging again.

176
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:23,420
No begging.

177
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:31,640
This begging thing...

178
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:35,380
it's the same as stealing.

179
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:42,960
It's stealing conscience from someone else's pocket, you know.

180
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:45,880
Conscience?

181
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:48,760
Did you just say conscience?

182
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:49,020
Boss?

183
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:50,500
Yes, conscience.

184
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:52,480
Boss, what's wrong?

185
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:54,540
What?

186
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:05,410
The kids from Supyogyo and Yeongcheon all came under the Boss because they heard that the beggars of Yeomcheon Bridge share everything equally and starve together.

187
00:13:05,610 --> 00:13:09,990
During the spring hardship, when even the market people had a hard time making ends meet, you even threw a rice cake party for the kids with mugwort from Inwangsan.

188
00:13:10,070 --> 00:13:10,590
Do you remember that?

189
00:13:10,930 --> 00:13:12,710
The Boss and I starved all day for that.

190
00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:13,930
Are you talking about that kind of conscience now?

191
00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:17,970
Or are you talking about the kind of conscience that gets drunk and then eats alone for a hangover cure in the morning?

192
00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:19,250
Hey, Parrot.

193
00:13:19,630 --> 00:13:21,190
You've changed a lot since you started seeing that woman, Boss.

194
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,520
I saw you in front of the photo studio.

195
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:55,270
Parrot.

196
00:13:58,910 --> 00:14:00,190
What should I do?

197
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:10,060
I can only think of that woman.

198
00:14:25,730 --> 00:14:27,490
I'll take some measures.

199
00:14:28,150 --> 00:14:30,770
How much pain must that clover-like foot be in, all frozen?

200
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:32,670
I wish it were my foot instead.

201
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:33,450
Move!

202
00:14:34,630 --> 00:14:35,370
Young master.

203
00:14:35,790 --> 00:14:38,590
Our little foxtail is dying from frostbite, isn't there anything we can do?

204
00:14:40,130 --> 00:14:41,630
It would be good to apply some Vaseline.

205
00:14:42,710 --> 00:14:43,130
What's that?

206
00:14:43,710 --> 00:14:44,250
Where do they sell it?

207
00:14:45,210 --> 00:14:46,570
Try rubbing his feet.

208
00:14:46,570 --> 00:14:49,630
Our young master graduated from medical school, so he's practically a doctor.

209
00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:52,070
In times like this, you should listen to a nobleman.

210
00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:54,990
Get out of the way!

211
00:14:55,310 --> 00:14:57,530
Don't worry about whether his foot rots and falls off.

212
00:14:59,710 --> 00:15:03,410
A guy like you who never washes his feet will never have that problem.

213
00:15:04,170 --> 00:15:06,450
Crow gets into trouble because he washes too often.

214
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:09,130
It's not that. It's because his foot can't breathe.

215
00:15:09,310 --> 00:15:10,350
Gimbap said so too.

216
00:15:11,050 --> 00:15:13,110
He said it's because it's tied too tight and the blood can't circulate.

217
00:15:13,510 --> 00:15:14,090
Come here for a second.

218
00:15:14,570 --> 00:15:16,270
Hey, where are you going without bowing your back?

219
00:15:17,470 --> 00:15:17,790
Hey!

220
00:15:18,330 --> 00:15:18,910
No!

221
00:15:19,030 --> 00:15:19,950
Absolutely not!

222
00:15:20,070 --> 00:15:22,190
Hey, is it that hard to learn how to pickpocket?

223
00:15:22,410 --> 00:15:24,470
The Boss will kill me if he finds out.

224
00:15:24,610 --> 00:15:25,770
Hey, how would the Boss know?

225
00:15:25,810 --> 00:15:26,650
We're just learning to pickpocket a little.

226
00:15:26,810 --> 00:15:29,010
Oh, what's so great about that mangy dog-like girl?

227
00:15:29,230 --> 00:15:30,630
Hey, do you still not understand how I feel?

228
00:15:31,050 --> 00:15:31,910
It says so in this book too.

229
00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:35,110
For a woman who can soothe a man's heart, he'll even give his soul.

230
00:15:35,170 --> 00:15:37,710
Whether you give your soul or your guts, you do it alone.

231
00:15:37,810 --> 00:15:40,570
Hey, are you just going to stand by and watch while Crow's toes are all frostbitten?

232
00:15:40,650 --> 00:15:42,270
I won't watch, and I won't do anything.

233
00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:43,830
The Boss will kill me if he finds out.

234
00:15:43,830 --> 00:15:44,990
Hey, how would the Boss know?

235
00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:47,510
We're just learning to pickpocket a little, without even the flea on your back knowing.

236
00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:47,830
I don't want to.

237
00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:49,110
Why should I, for that girl?

238
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:50,810
Are you really going to be like this?

239
00:15:51,010 --> 00:15:51,510
I'm not going.

240
00:15:51,630 --> 00:15:54,550
Whether you beg on your knees or prostrate yourself, I'm not going.

241
00:15:55,130 --> 00:15:55,770
Hey, hey, hey.

242
00:15:55,810 --> 00:15:56,010
Don't go.

243
00:15:56,550 --> 00:15:57,030
Don't go.

244
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:06,100
There's probably no other beggar in the world as kind as you.

245
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:09,400
If you just get this one thing for me, I'll respect you more than this book.

246
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:09,960
Got it?

247
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:12,820
Respect or not, what are you talking about right now?

248
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:13,800
Next time, just put a muzzle on it.

249
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:14,520
Got it, you punk?

250
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,260
Alright, let's go to the pharmacy.

251
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:20,960
Let's find it.

252
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:22,380
Oh, my goodness.

253
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:22,780
Oh, my goodness.

254
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:24,420
She must have had a seizure.

255
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:25,480
Oh my, oh my, oh my.

256
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:26,600
Hey, move the book.

257
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:28,040
What's with this damn book?

258
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:30,240
It's better to be treated like a nobleman than to be ignored.

259
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:31,820
You have to pretend to know what's going on to get better.

260
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:32,060
Got it?

261
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:32,660
Got it.

262
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:34,300
Just a moment.

263
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,860
But where did you see the pharmacy?

264
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:44,620
Hello.

265
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:50,100
Hey, what does it say?

266
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:51,500
What's that?

267
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:56,040
Hey, you've been carrying books around all day and you don't even know that, you idiot?

268
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:57,440
I don't know if that's Chinese, you punk.

269
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:59,680
It seemed like Korean. How would I know?

270
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:02,200
Anyway, we'll know once we get inside the book.

271
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:03,860
Alright, I get it.

272
00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:05,600
Words are words.

273
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:07,740
Korean or Chinese, they're all the same.

274
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:10,640
Hurry up.

275
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:20,620
Come out.

276
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:47,280
What are you doing?

277
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:48,180
Aren't you looking for medicine?

278
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:49,500
Got it, you punk.

279
00:17:54,630 --> 00:17:56,710
You don't know that's Chinese, right?

280
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:21,360
There's a smell.

281
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:24,560
Ah, the smell is indescribable.

282
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:25,680
Not that smell, you punk.

283
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:28,160
It feels like it's right around here.

284
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:29,760
I have a feeling.

285
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:35,220
Doesn't it smell like medicine?

286
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:37,060
What smell?

287
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:43,200
You can't fool my nose.

288
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:44,760
Try farting in Mapo.

289
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:46,040
I can smell it all the way from Yeomcheon Bridge, man.

290
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:46,440
I know everything.

291
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:47,320
Follow me.

292
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:03,320
As far as they're concerned, I'm already dead.

293
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:07,340
There was a false report in the newspaper.

294
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:11,960
Since it was in the paper, there was a reason to send you.

295
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:15,260
The police must have given up on you by now.

296
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,300
You don't exist in this world.

297
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:27,640
Do you know that for you, I've specially brought a doctor renowned for his skills in Gyeongseong?

298
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:33,220
I've asked the doctor to treat you well more than once.

299
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:38,060
It was because I was so worried you wouldn't survive this ordeal.

300
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:40,820
I know.

301
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:47,800
I know that even if they captured your parents and tortured them in front of you, you would never open your mouth.

302
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:54,600
Unfortunately, the conscience of the Great Japanese Empire will never put a prisoner in a hospital gown on the gallows.

303
00:20:58,540 --> 00:21:06,540
You need to recover quickly so you can stand in court sooner, and I can see you with a rope around your neck that much sooner.

304
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:20,260
What a stubborn woman.

305
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:21,840
Are you giving up on your sainthood?

306
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:23,000
I don't have time for that.

307
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:23,900
I have to find Lee Han-young.

308
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:24,540
Lee Han-young!

309
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:29,440
That's the cop who raided our shack looking for your Young Master.

310
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:31,620
That sign clearly said Lee Han-young.

311
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:32,240
So what?

312
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:33,440
He's not our Young Master.

313
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:34,240
Gimbap?

314
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:34,800
Yeah.

315
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:43,120
That woman who's inside isn't dead.

316
00:22:30,090 --> 00:22:32,010
Manager, someone is waiting for you over there.

317
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:40,720
Has Manager Abe arrived?

318
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:47,240
It's an honor to meet you like this.

319
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:53,700
I've always wanted to meet someone like you, sir.

320
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:54,920
Who are you?

321
00:22:55,420 --> 00:23:04,660
I'm just a guy who gathers the homeless in the back alleys of Bokrae-dong in Namdaemun and tries to make a living.

322
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:16,640
I came here to pay my respects to the great police chief of the Japanese Empire who is working hard for the peace of Gyeongseong.

323
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:18,500
Did you come all this way just for that?

324
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:19,940
That's not all.

325
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:27,000
I heard that the police station is short on people lately.

326
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:32,140
I was thinking of using a guy named Anchovy from Yeomcheon Bridge, but it was a total failure.

327
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:34,540
Even if I were to be reborn, I wouldn't be any different from that guy.

328
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:41,120
Manager, you've completely misjudged the man.

329
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:49,220
That kid is a bull in a china shop. He'd die from my tail whip. How can you say he's no different from me?

330
00:23:56,690 --> 00:23:58,670
Min-jae... is Min-jae in that hospital?

331
00:23:59,350 --> 00:24:00,070
It's true.

332
00:24:00,330 --> 00:24:01,310
The newspaper said she was dead.

333
00:24:01,630 --> 00:24:02,290
We saw it.

334
00:24:02,390 --> 00:24:03,090
Hey, we saw it, right?

335
00:24:03,210 --> 00:24:03,530
Right?

336
00:24:03,530 --> 00:24:03,810
Huh?

337
00:24:04,130 --> 00:24:04,990
Uh, uh, uh.

338
00:24:05,050 --> 00:24:07,870
That policeman who my mom was with.

339
00:24:08,010 --> 00:24:11,630
He said that the woman wouldn't talk even if she died, so they had to catch the young master quickly.

340
00:24:13,610 --> 00:24:15,030
How's the security at the hospital room?

341
00:24:15,190 --> 00:24:15,870
How many are guarding it?

342
00:24:16,130 --> 00:24:18,010
In front of the main entrance of the hospital.

343
00:24:18,430 --> 00:24:19,370
There are two guards.

344
00:24:19,570 --> 00:24:21,490
And there's another one guarding right in front of the hospital room.

345
00:24:21,790 --> 00:24:24,770
They're all carrying guns, so we can't even dream of getting close.

346
00:24:24,790 --> 00:24:27,830
Hey, the young master will take care of the dreaming part. What do you know to be talking like that?

347
00:24:27,890 --> 00:24:28,790
He's not in critical condition, is he?

348
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:30,690
I don't know if he's in critical condition.

349
00:24:31,430 --> 00:24:33,470
The nurse and the doctor were going in and out a lot.

350
00:24:33,470 --> 00:24:34,530
Where's the Boss now?

351
00:24:35,170 --> 00:24:36,170
He's probably at the King Star.

352
00:24:36,230 --> 00:24:37,270
With Du-han.

353
00:24:37,830 --> 00:24:38,830
No, where are you going?

354
00:24:41,050 --> 00:24:41,650
I have to meet him.

355
00:24:41,690 --> 00:24:42,030
Right now.

356
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:45,270
But they even know your name, Young Master. Are you going out into the city?

357
00:24:45,850 --> 00:24:49,750
You have a horse that understands human speech and knows everything. Where are you going?

358
00:24:52,870 --> 00:24:53,670
I'm not going!

359
00:24:54,450 --> 00:24:55,810
Where are you going in the evening?

360
00:24:55,930 --> 00:24:56,810
I'm starving.

361
00:24:57,070 --> 00:24:58,970
There's no other kind beggar like you in the world.

362
00:24:59,030 --> 00:25:03,010
If you just go to the Boss once this time, I'll respect you more than I respect this book.

363
00:25:03,010 --> 00:25:04,130
No, I said I'm not going.

364
00:25:04,610 --> 00:25:05,430
Are you really going to do this again?

365
00:25:05,510 --> 00:25:06,030
I'm not going!

366
00:25:08,230 --> 00:25:10,430
It's better to differentiate based on income.

367
00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:16,830
The individual rooms or side rooms behind this pavilion don't bring in much money, so you can charge 2 won.

368
00:25:17,270 --> 00:25:22,310
But in the case of the shrine or the gilt house on the other side of the lamp, they look shabby on the outside.

369
00:25:23,070 --> 00:25:24,690
But it can be fun.

370
00:25:25,150 --> 00:25:26,150
You can charge 3 won.

371
00:25:26,970 --> 00:25:27,410
Got it.

372
00:25:27,930 --> 00:25:28,590
Hey, and by the way.

373
00:25:28,830 --> 00:25:30,190
From now on...

374
00:25:30,190 --> 00:25:34,430
If there's a gathering of influential people in the city, you go there yourself and make a good impression.

375
00:25:34,970 --> 00:25:38,130
Those Japanese bastards need to know who they're doing business with, right?

376
00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:39,410
That's right.

377
00:25:39,710 --> 00:25:48,070
And as I always say, take care of our kids' jobs. A theater guard is fine, a hotel errand boy is fine. Our kids can do anything.

378
00:25:49,350 --> 00:25:50,930
And one more thing, you.

379
00:25:51,070 --> 00:25:52,490
You have to act like a real boss.

380
00:25:52,870 --> 00:25:54,010
What are you wearing?

381
00:25:54,010 --> 00:25:57,670
First of all, if you're a boss, you have to slick your hair back.

382
00:25:58,110 --> 00:25:59,590
Slick it back, I said.

383
00:25:59,910 --> 00:26:00,990
Make your forehead shiny.

384
00:26:01,330 --> 00:26:04,010
And then Double-Blade, that little dwarf.

385
00:26:04,250 --> 00:26:05,610
Why are you wearing stripes?

386
00:26:05,670 --> 00:26:07,130
Stripes suit you.

387
00:26:07,630 --> 00:26:08,750
Try wearing a suit with pinstripes.

388
00:26:09,210 --> 00:26:11,770
And like Double-Blade, don't interfere when you shouldn't, and interfere when you should.

389
00:26:12,570 --> 00:26:14,050
You haven't even been buried yet.

390
00:26:14,550 --> 00:26:15,530
Look at Double-Blade's face.

391
00:26:15,590 --> 00:26:17,950
After being beaten by his underling, he has to go to Manchuria.

392
00:26:17,950 --> 00:26:18,210
Huh?

393
00:26:24,330 --> 00:26:25,410
Manchuria is a bit...

394
00:26:26,110 --> 00:26:26,790
Manchuria.

395
00:26:27,350 --> 00:26:28,750
Hey, that bastard.

396
00:26:29,110 --> 00:26:34,110
He likes face and all that, but he hates bad smells.

397
00:26:34,970 --> 00:26:36,130
But why go there, man?

398
00:26:36,710 --> 00:26:37,430
It's our land too.

399
00:26:37,570 --> 00:26:38,250
No.

400
00:26:39,790 --> 00:26:40,770
That's not it.

401
00:26:42,090 --> 00:26:46,290
Everyone said you went to Manchuria, sir.

402
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:57,020
I've lived in Jongno for 30 years, and I'll live here for that much longer.

403
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:04,720
Just because I took off my jacket for Du-han, has the sentiment in this neighborhood become so harsh that I can't live here anymore?

404
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:06,800
Is that right, Du-han?

405
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:16,100
No, sir.

406
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:23,500
Before the blood from the double-edged sword has even dried, has the spirit of the fists in this neighborhood become so dirty that you would stab me in the back, Du-han?

407
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:24,900
No, sir.

408
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:27,160
Yes, I know.

409
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:30,240
I'm a stray dog that has left its home now.

410
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:33,980
I know it's pathetic to be sniffing around the gate again.

411
00:27:34,540 --> 00:27:42,300
But, my 30 years in Jongno, my 30 years with these fists, are so sad.

412
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:48,400
The road to Manchuria is too far, Du-han.

413
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:52,920
Why go all the way to Manchuria to eat Chinese pancakes?

414
00:27:53,660 --> 00:27:54,400
They're more delicious here.

415
00:27:55,700 --> 00:28:00,260
Grasshopper, get your Double-Blade brother the biggest glass of gwiraso hyangju.

416
00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:01,940
Yes, yes.

417
00:28:13,590 --> 00:28:16,110
If a ladder knows how to go up, it should also know how to come down.

418
00:28:18,290 --> 00:28:20,630
I only learned how to win fights, not how to lose.

419
00:28:21,610 --> 00:28:23,090
Hey, if you don't know, I'll show you the way.

420
00:28:27,290 --> 00:28:30,830
Just because the old Boss came under me, doesn't mean I'll ignore him.

421
00:28:31,150 --> 00:28:31,450
Right?

422
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:39,800
Boss!

423
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:43,600
There's a problem.

424
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:45,390
I think you need to go to Yeomcheon Bridge.

425
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:46,460
Why?

426
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:51,500
Well, Gimbap told me to get you, sir.

427
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:53,140
Who's Gimbap?

428
00:28:54,740 --> 00:28:55,820
Got a cigarette?

429
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:09,900
Money is good, but a person's life is more important.

430
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:11,460
That's exactly what I wanted to say.

431
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:17,240
If you lend me a little bit of your strength, we can save the life of a great comrade who is fighting for independence.

432
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:21,200
If we get caught, what are you going to do about the lives of the beggars?

433
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:27,200
I know the structure of the hospital well because I've been in and out of it a lot for the past two years in Gyeongseong.

434
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:30,080
If we plan it well, there will be no great danger.

435
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:31,440
How much will you give us?

436
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:33,200
We won't do it for any amount.

437
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:34,760
Didn't I tell you?

438
00:29:36,060 --> 00:29:37,780
We can't last long on just trash.

439
00:29:37,780 --> 00:29:41,680
But if we get caught, we'll rot in jail for the rest of our lives.

440
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:43,000
No.

441
00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:47,100
If we just do as the young master says, we can get him out without any trouble.

442
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:48,720
What do you mean, no trouble, man?

443
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:51,800
We're trying to get a person out of a place guarded by three patrolmen with guns.

444
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:52,700
It's one or the other.

445
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:57,340
Either we listen to him, or we go back to begging, or we all starve to death.

446
00:29:58,780 --> 00:30:00,000
I'd rather starve to death.

447
00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:09,520
If everything had gone according to plan, I would be on a cruise ship on the Huangpu River in Shanghai right now.

448
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:10,460
With my wife.

449
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:12,200
Are you married?

450
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:13,140
No, I couldn't.

451
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:17,340
The person who was supposed to be my wife is now lying in a hospital bed in Gyeongseong.

452
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:21,600
The plan was to assassinate Governor-General Endo and get married in Shanghai.

453
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:25,340
She's the woman who taught me about freedom and love.

454
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:29,520
Oh, so that note...

455
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:30,800
Yes.

456
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:36,320
You of all people should know how precious love is to a man.

457
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:39,660
What's love...

458
00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:40,980
It's more precious than anything in the world.

459
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:44,640
More than honor, wealth, and money.

460
00:30:56,340 --> 00:30:57,640
How much can you get?

461
00:30:58,560 --> 00:30:59,700
I can get 300 won.

462
00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:02,800
That's enough to buy thirty bags of rice...

463
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:09,720
It's not because of the woman.

464
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:14,320
I just want to put some warm rice in our kids' stomachs for a change.

465
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:19,120
Hama!

466
00:31:28,130 --> 00:31:29,430
Don't forget Ms. Park Hyeon-sim.

467
00:31:29,750 --> 00:31:31,130
Yes, I understand.

468
00:31:32,670 --> 00:31:36,350
I came to see Ms. Park Hyeon-sim.

469
00:31:37,290 --> 00:31:39,690
I've read Mr. Park Gye-ju's book three and a half times.

470
00:31:40,230 --> 00:31:41,190
My name is Choi Hong-pal.

471
00:31:41,530 --> 00:31:42,770
No one knows me as Choi Hong-pal.

472
00:31:42,830 --> 00:31:43,790
They call me Hama.

473
00:31:44,430 --> 00:31:45,750
My real name is Man-suk...

474
00:32:04,130 --> 00:32:07,510
The director sent this again.

475
00:32:09,450 --> 00:32:13,890
The Director of Finance at the Government-General is no ordinary person. What are you relying on to be so arrogant?

476
00:32:14,810 --> 00:32:15,750
I'm not relying on anything.

477
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:25,660
What kind of gift is it this time?

478
00:32:26,060 --> 00:32:26,700
Don't touch it.

479
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:29,740
Can't I just take a little peek and then glue it back with rice paste?

480
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:30,300
No.

481
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:34,120
I don't know why men are so stupid.

482
00:32:34,580 --> 00:32:40,380
They don't even think of giving a rice cake to someone who's dying for one, and they keep sending them to someone who runs away scared at the sight of one.

483
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:41,660
Then you take it.

484
00:32:42,020 --> 00:32:43,580
You can meet Director Ikeda, too.

485
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:44,120
No thanks.

486
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:46,480
Why would I meet a man who's desperately clinging to you?

487
00:32:50,060 --> 00:32:51,140
Where did you get that?

488
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:53,900
It was all dried up and shriveled in the corner of your room.

489
00:32:54,460 --> 00:32:55,960
It was going to be eaten anyway, so what does it matter who eats it?

490
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:57,300
It wasn't for eating.

491
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:58,000
Then what?

492
00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:04,460
You were going to keep it, looking at it over and over until it got all shriveled up, weren't you?

493
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:06,820
What am I going to do? I'm so sorry.

494
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:08,740
I'll buy you another tangerine.

495
00:33:09,340 --> 00:33:13,160
Even if you buy me a gold one or a silver one, or a whole box, it won't be the same.

496
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:17,060
Did that Kim Chunsam person give you that?

497
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:21,280
You really don't know how to judge men.

498
00:33:21,820 --> 00:33:24,320
The real man among men is Kim Du-han.

499
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:31,020
His shoulders are as broad as a school playground, and his fists are as hard as iron.

500
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:38,260
Don't you think the flower of youth will bloom brilliantly if you get to be held in the arms of such a wonderful man just once?

501
00:33:40,780 --> 00:33:41,860
Um...

502
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:44,380
Please!

503
00:33:44,380 --> 00:33:45,680
No, Park-no!

504
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:47,820
Um, that's not...

505
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:50,340
Who are you?

506
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:54,640
I'm not a suspicious or bad person.

507
00:33:54,740 --> 00:33:57,600
I'm a respectable person who respects books, so please don't worry.

508
00:33:58,020 --> 00:34:01,900
And this book is a book that I respect very much.

509
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:05,740
I've read it three and a half times, staying up all night in感動.

510
00:34:05,860 --> 00:34:06,640
And this book is...

511
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:09,160
Are you... from Yeomcheon Bridge?

512
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:11,160
Yes, that's right.

513
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:13,360
But I didn't come here representing Yeomcheon Bridge.

514
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:14,480
What's the matter?

515
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:18,380
I came to see Ms. Park Hyeon-sim.

516
00:34:18,660 --> 00:34:19,240
Park Hyeon-sim?

517
00:34:19,580 --> 00:34:20,760
Who's Park Hyeon-sim?

518
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:21,800
There's no gisaeng like that here.

519
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:23,780
Ms. Park isn't here right now.

520
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:25,800
She'll be here tomorrow, but what's the matter?

521
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:34,300
The Boss takes the disguised me to the warehouse and immediately fixes the cart and waits outside the emergency room entrance.

522
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:41,080
Meanwhile, Parrot, disguised as a doctor, says Min-jae is in critical condition, takes him out of the hospital room, and brings him to the emergency room.

523
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:42,660
Wait...

524
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:46,560
How do you make a healthy person into a corpse?

525
00:34:47,660 --> 00:34:48,840
You kill him.

526
00:34:50,220 --> 00:34:52,040
Hey, be quiet.

527
00:34:52,180 --> 00:34:52,620
Okay.

528
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:54,200
Gimbap, continue.

529
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:57,720
Once in the emergency room, there's a side door leading outside.

530
00:34:58,380 --> 00:35:00,880
We take him out through there and load him onto the waiting cart.

531
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:03,660
If you just cover him with a sheet, he becomes a corpse.

532
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:07,740
What do you say if they ask why you're taking the corpse back?

533
00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:10,400
You can say he was rejected because he was too decomposed.

534
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:13,400
Wait, how do you make a fresh corpse decompose?

535
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:16,900
You can just leave it in a warm furnace to rot.

536
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:19,940
Sit down.

537
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:20,700
Sit down.

538
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,000
Hey, that's enough.

539
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:23,000
I told you to be quiet.

540
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:23,480
Sit down.

541
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:24,220
Sit down.

542
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:25,620
Just be quiet.

543
00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:31,900
What about the patrolmen?

544
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:35,240
They probably won't come inside the emergency room.

545
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:37,720
Even if they try to, we have to stop them.

546
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:38,880
How do you get out?

547
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:42,080
Let's walk out of the warehouse on our bare feet.

548
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:45,200
Wait, how does a corpse walk out?

549
00:35:50,110 --> 00:35:51,170
He's supposed to be a corpse.

550
00:35:51,530 --> 00:35:53,230
See, this is a problem.

551
00:35:53,370 --> 00:35:54,610
This is completely insane.

552
00:35:54,970 --> 00:35:55,850
No, if I pretend to be sick...

553
00:35:55,850 --> 00:35:57,130
Doesn't this make no sense?

554
00:35:57,210 --> 00:35:58,210
Hey, that's enough.

555
00:35:58,270 --> 00:35:58,470
That's enough.

556
00:35:58,530 --> 00:35:58,750
Be quiet.

557
00:36:00,130 --> 00:36:03,700
Gimbap knows the hospital well, so he can get out on his own.

558
00:36:05,470 --> 00:36:07,850
Alright, everyone understands?

559
00:36:10,010 --> 00:36:11,910
Alright, listen up again.

560
00:36:12,630 --> 00:36:18,530
Parrot will change clothes in this changing room, go to this hospital room, get Min-jae, and come to the emergency room.

561
00:36:19,350 --> 00:36:20,890
Out the side door of the emergency room.

562
00:36:21,550 --> 00:36:22,770
Alright, got it?

563
00:36:30,110 --> 00:36:30,810
Hey, that's enough.

564
00:36:30,930 --> 00:36:31,450
That's enough.

565
00:36:32,050 --> 00:36:36,530
Fly, you take Gimbap to the dye factory and paint him blue.

566
00:36:36,570 --> 00:36:36,850
Got it?

567
00:36:38,110 --> 00:36:40,770
And Parrot, you take Raccoon and fix the broken cart.

568
00:36:41,270 --> 00:36:43,690
Oh, and Fly, you stay in the shack with Crow.

569
00:36:44,190 --> 00:36:45,990
Hey, Boss, why are you leaving me out?

570
00:36:47,210 --> 00:36:49,230
It would be much safer to leave out Left Foot.

571
00:36:50,370 --> 00:36:51,510
Hey, hey, shut up.

572
00:36:51,690 --> 00:36:52,170
Shut up.

573
00:36:52,490 --> 00:36:54,470
Someone has to stay behind and look after the little ones.

574
00:36:55,010 --> 00:36:57,270
But, Boss, I'm, I'm much better than him...

575
00:36:57,270 --> 00:36:58,450
Hey, why are you ignoring me?

576
00:36:58,950 --> 00:36:59,510
Hey, you punk.

577
00:36:59,850 --> 00:37:00,370
Give me my clothes.

578
00:37:00,630 --> 00:37:01,150
Give me my clothes.

579
00:37:01,430 --> 00:37:01,770
Give me my clothes.

580
00:37:02,050 --> 00:37:02,250
Hey, wait a minute.

581
00:37:02,550 --> 00:37:03,290
Did you meet them?

582
00:37:03,350 --> 00:37:03,470
Yes.

583
00:37:03,750 --> 00:37:04,090
And the money?

584
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:06,910
The chopsticks?

585
00:37:07,130 --> 00:37:07,270
Yes.

586
00:37:07,570 --> 00:37:08,030
Good work.

587
00:37:08,190 --> 00:37:08,630
The chopsticks, right?

588
00:37:08,890 --> 00:37:09,690
Give me my clothes.

589
00:37:09,850 --> 00:37:10,250
Give me my clothes.

590
00:37:10,630 --> 00:37:11,430
Give me my clothes.

591
00:37:11,470 --> 00:37:11,930
Hey, Hama.

592
00:37:12,710 --> 00:37:13,570
Let me see it.

593
00:37:13,710 --> 00:37:14,930
I counted it, there's a lot.

594
00:37:15,330 --> 00:37:15,650
Yeah, let me see.

595
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:16,670
It's over 300 won.

596
00:37:16,790 --> 00:37:17,430
Yeah, let me see.

597
00:37:17,530 --> 00:37:19,290
Young master, is this ours now?

598
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:25,980
I couldn't meet him.

599
00:37:26,780 --> 00:37:28,020
He was out somewhere.

600
00:37:33,510 --> 00:37:34,510
Give me my clothes.

601
00:37:34,930 --> 00:37:36,110
Fly and I are dead.

602
00:37:39,930 --> 00:37:40,470
I couldn't get it.

603
00:37:43,610 --> 00:37:45,050
Boss, I'm sorry.

604
00:37:45,490 --> 00:37:47,190
I didn't mean to deceive you, Boss.

605
00:37:47,850 --> 00:37:50,910
I just wanted to help the young master in any way I could.

606
00:37:51,730 --> 00:37:52,890
I couldn't get it today, but...

607
00:37:53,170 --> 00:37:54,870
I'll definitely be able to get it next time.

608
00:37:58,450 --> 00:37:59,930
Hey, Hama.

609
00:37:59,930 --> 00:38:01,590
Go get the cart wheels.

610
00:38:01,670 --> 00:38:02,410
I'm so heavy.

611
00:38:03,050 --> 00:38:03,350
Oh, right.

612
00:38:03,430 --> 00:38:04,090
Hama.

613
00:38:04,190 --> 00:38:05,150
Let me see the money.

614
00:38:05,510 --> 00:38:06,910
I've never spent 300 won in my life.

615
00:38:07,390 --> 00:38:08,090
Go and get ready.

616
00:38:12,790 --> 00:38:13,950
Get ready.

617
00:38:13,950 --> 00:38:14,950
Hey, Hama.

618
00:38:15,770 --> 00:38:17,290
Keep the money safe.

619
00:38:18,390 --> 00:38:19,130
Got it?

620
00:38:21,270 --> 00:38:21,510
Yes!

621
00:38:22,450 --> 00:38:22,870
Got it.

622
00:38:28,780 --> 00:38:30,160
You bastard.

623
00:38:30,940 --> 00:38:32,860
You're joking around when you're supposed to be getting ready.

624
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:33,500
Hey!

625
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:34,920
Hey, Hama.

626
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:35,260
Hurry up.

627
00:38:36,260 --> 00:38:36,920
Be careful.

628
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:37,560
This is heavy.

629
00:38:39,820 --> 00:38:40,660
Okay.

630
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:40,940
Okay.

631
00:38:41,020 --> 00:38:41,280
Grab it.

632
00:38:43,340 --> 00:38:44,360
It's not heavy.

633
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:45,200
It's not heavy.

634
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:46,980
Hey, hold on to that fly.

635
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:47,920
It's not heavy.

636
00:38:47,940 --> 00:38:48,460
It's not heavy.

637
00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:50,020
Hey, it's not heavy.

638
00:38:50,260 --> 00:38:56,200
Why are you taking that?

639
00:38:58,080 --> 00:38:58,430
To take a bath.

640
00:39:33,020 --> 00:39:33,380
Hey.

641
00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:33,920
Hey, what about this?

642
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:34,220
Hey,

643
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:42,100
Hey, hey.

644
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:42,720
Hama, stop hitting.

645
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:45,760
Hurry.

646
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:51,260
Hey, Barefoot.

647
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:51,560
Catch.

648
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:56,480
Barefoot.

649
00:39:58,260 --> 00:39:58,940
Just a moment.

650
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:04,640
Hey, where did Raccoon go?

651
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:05,700
He's in the back.

652
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:07,000
Raccoon, hurry up and come out.

653
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:07,500
Hey, that's enough.

654
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:09,540
Tell him to stay behind and guard the shack.

655
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:09,940
Hey, let's go.

656
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:11,240
Let's go.

657
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:14,620
Boss, can't I go instead of Raccoon?

658
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:15,040
That's enough.

659
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:16,220
Stay here with your sister.

660
00:40:33,580 --> 00:40:36,230
Is that bitch Haewol really all that?

661
00:40:39,940 --> 00:40:41,030
How pretty is she?

662
00:40:43,730 --> 00:40:46,210
Now that I think about it, she's just so-so.

663
00:40:47,610 --> 00:40:50,930
Don't lie and tell me the truth. How pretty is she?

664
00:40:51,790 --> 00:40:52,670
Sis.

665
00:40:58,270 --> 00:41:05,130
No matter how good a rubber shoe is, it looks like trash next to a leather shoe.

666
00:41:07,030 --> 00:41:09,570
Sis, when we're together, we're like rubber shoes, but

667
00:41:13,270 --> 00:41:16,810
honestly, next to a gisaeng, we're not even straw sandals.

668
00:41:27,210 --> 00:41:29,890
What should I say if they ask how he died?

669
00:41:30,270 --> 00:41:30,950
Say he starved to death.

670
00:41:31,390 --> 00:41:31,970
Say he froze to death.

671
00:41:32,070 --> 00:41:33,270
It's better to say he died from an illness.

672
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:14,030
You have no right to judge me.

673
00:42:27,650 --> 00:42:30,250
Nurse, please call a doctor from the emergency room quickly.

674
00:42:30,250 --> 00:42:30,750
What doctor?

675
00:42:30,930 --> 00:42:31,090
Where?

676
00:42:31,510 --> 00:42:33,450
Go to the emergency room and get him quickly.

677
00:42:36,270 --> 00:42:36,670
What?

678
00:42:39,670 --> 00:42:42,190
Did you say they use students to practice cutting people open in this hospital?

679
00:42:42,510 --> 00:42:45,890
I came because they said they'd give me some money for a corpse, but he has a disease.

680
00:42:46,030 --> 00:42:46,770
I'm going to get a disease.

681
00:42:47,430 --> 00:42:47,670
Go in.

682
00:42:53,860 --> 00:42:56,360
Sir, where is the emergency room?

683
00:42:56,780 --> 00:42:58,200
I collapsed after vomiting and having diarrhea all day...

684
00:43:01,140 --> 00:43:02,660
It's over there to the left.

685
00:43:04,260 --> 00:43:05,520
Thank you, sir.

686
00:43:21,830 --> 00:43:22,590
Well

687
00:43:52,950 --> 00:43:53,650
I don't know.

688
00:43:54,390 --> 00:43:54,890
Is it a sport?

689
00:43:55,690 --> 00:43:56,490
Get the doctor ready.

690
00:43:56,650 --> 00:43:57,090
Yes, I understand.

691
00:44:31,320 --> 00:44:32,980
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

692
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:35,780
Are you coming from Ogin-dong?

693
00:44:37,460 --> 00:44:40,060
Are you coming from the homeless shelter in Ogin-dong?

694
00:44:41,620 --> 00:44:42,280
Pardon?

695
00:44:43,740 --> 00:44:44,400
Yes.

696
00:44:44,980 --> 00:44:46,700
Ah, so you're just coming home now?

697
00:44:47,240 --> 00:44:47,680
Follow me!

698
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:50,240
Hey, what are you doing?

699
00:44:50,360 --> 00:44:51,060
Aren't you going to follow me?

700
00:45:07,740 --> 00:45:09,060
Hey, corpse!

701
00:45:09,660 --> 00:45:10,380
Be quiet!

702
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:17,680
Ah, really...

703
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:21,020
Come this way, this way.

704
00:45:27,090 --> 00:45:28,170
Leave it over there and go.

705
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:38,820
Oh, lay the corpse down properly.

706
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:53,820
What time does this gentleman plan to start?

707
00:45:56,080 --> 00:45:56,800
Sigh...

708
00:45:58,740 --> 00:45:59,640
Huh?

709
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:01,600
Hey, hyung, this is a woman's.

710
00:46:01,720 --> 00:46:02,560
She has breasts.

711
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:03,500
I see.

712
00:46:08,060 --> 00:46:09,260
Young master, what should we do?

713
00:46:10,340 --> 00:46:11,360
Let's just wait a bit.

714
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:15,520
What if they think she's really dead and cut her open...

715
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:16,100
Don't worry.

716
00:46:16,120 --> 00:46:17,300
She's not a real corpse.

717
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:19,280
We're in big trouble.

718
00:46:20,300 --> 00:46:21,240
What should we do?

719
00:46:22,080 --> 00:46:23,160
I don't know.

720
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:24,080
Don't ask me.

721
00:46:45,080 --> 00:46:46,420
Button up, you bastard.

722
00:46:58,620 --> 00:47:00,020
Hey, Boss...

723
00:47:00,020 --> 00:47:02,700
If he doesn't come out, should I go in and lie to him?

724
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:04,060
Stop pushing me.

725
00:47:04,360 --> 00:47:05,180
That's not it.

726
00:47:05,880 --> 00:47:12,360
A woman's heart is weaker than a foxtail, so can't you say something warm to Crow once in a while?

727
00:47:13,480 --> 00:47:22,040
That poor thing only has eyes for you, Boss. I'm worried she'll go crazy if she finds out you're interested in someone else.

728
00:47:38,210 --> 00:47:38,730
What are you doing?

729
00:47:38,770 --> 00:47:39,450
Let's go.

730
00:47:57,140 --> 00:47:58,180
Hey, where are you?

731
00:47:59,120 --> 00:47:59,800
Is it sushi today?

732
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:01,820
The order was sitting right here.

733
00:48:02,120 --> 00:48:02,940
Oh, you stupid bastard.

734
00:48:02,940 --> 00:48:03,460
You don't know where it is?

735
00:48:04,320 --> 00:48:05,280
Why don't you know?

736
00:48:06,040 --> 00:48:06,960
It's one of two.

737
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:08,220
So which of the two is it?

738
00:48:08,340 --> 00:48:09,720
I miss the future or a bear's paw.

739
00:48:09,740 --> 00:48:10,640
I'm not a bear's paw.

740
00:48:10,740 --> 00:48:11,540
I'm Barefoot.

741
00:48:11,700 --> 00:48:12,020
Hey, I got it.

742
00:48:12,080 --> 00:48:12,900
Stop nagging and just tell me.

743
00:48:12,980 --> 00:48:13,520
Is it here or there?

744
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:13,920
Where is it?

745
00:48:14,040 --> 00:48:14,180
Uh.

746
00:48:14,860 --> 00:48:15,380
Where is it?

747
00:48:15,580 --> 00:48:15,980
It's here.

748
00:48:24,490 --> 00:48:25,010
Where is it?

749
00:48:25,330 --> 00:48:25,870
There's no one here.

750
00:48:27,110 --> 00:48:27,630
It's the next room.

751
00:48:36,380 --> 00:48:37,380
See, I was right.

752
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:38,640
I told you it was this room.

753
00:48:39,100 --> 00:48:40,040
Here, cover her up quickly.

754
00:48:40,260 --> 00:48:40,400
Okay.

755
00:48:43,360 --> 00:48:43,920
Be quiet.

756
00:48:43,980 --> 00:48:44,320
Be quiet.

757
00:48:44,460 --> 00:48:45,340
We came to rescue you.

758
00:48:45,840 --> 00:48:46,360
Gimbap.

759
00:48:46,580 --> 00:48:47,080
You know Gimbap, right?

760
00:48:51,120 --> 00:48:51,640
Be quiet.

761
00:48:51,640 --> 00:48:52,160
Be quiet.

762
00:49:01,940 --> 00:49:02,540
Be quiet.

763
00:49:06,120 --> 00:49:06,760
Be quiet.

764
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:14,000
Boss, it's done.

765
00:49:14,360 --> 00:49:15,320
We found the right one.

766
00:49:15,580 --> 00:49:16,360
We need to get out of here.

767
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:17,920
What about the young master?

768
00:49:18,060 --> 00:49:18,820
Where did Gimbap go?

769
00:49:19,740 --> 00:49:20,260
What about the young master?

770
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:20,940
Get him quickly.

771
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:25,260
We're all going to die.

772
00:49:26,196 --> 00:49:27,040
What about the young master?

773
00:49:27,420 --> 00:49:27,800
I don't know.

774
00:49:29,380 --> 00:49:30,260
Take him and wait.

775
00:49:30,320 --> 00:49:30,599
Got it?

776
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:31,420
Got it, Boss.

777
00:49:32,280 --> 00:49:33,060
Be quiet.

778
00:49:33,060 --> 00:49:34,020
Be quiet.

779
00:49:36,760 --> 00:49:37,800
Can't you move a little faster?

780
00:49:38,920 --> 00:49:39,560
Come on, hurry.

781
00:49:48,433 --> 00:49:49,513
Sir, good work.

782
00:49:49,620 --> 00:49:51,460
Getting antibiotics wasn't easy.

783
00:49:51,700 --> 00:49:53,200
We're lucky to have this much.

784
00:49:53,340 --> 00:49:55,680
By the way, you're doing an autopsy with Dr. Park, right?

785
00:49:56,620 --> 00:49:57,440
You go ahead.

786
00:49:57,560 --> 00:49:58,740
We'll take care of this patient.

787
00:49:59,180 --> 00:49:59,920
Good luck.

788
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:10,980
Sir, isn't it too late?

789
00:50:10,980 --> 00:50:12,560
We can do it tomorrow.

790
00:50:12,980 --> 00:50:14,560
This guy is already talking about dying.

791
00:50:14,680 --> 00:50:15,220
Hurry up and prepare.

792
00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:18,940
I didn't get a wink of sleep last night.

793
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:20,880
This is going to rot quickly.

794
00:50:22,300 --> 00:50:24,800
I'm going to the director's office, so get him ready for the autopsy and wait.

795
00:50:25,380 --> 00:50:25,880
Got it?

796
00:50:26,520 --> 00:50:26,840
Yes.

797
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:31,480
Be prepared to die tonight.

798
00:50:37,153 --> 00:50:39,193
Be prepared to die tonight.

799
00:51:32,570 --> 00:51:33,730
Sir, what happened?

800
00:51:34,350 --> 00:51:35,490
What happened?

801
00:51:36,030 --> 00:51:37,470
Sir, please save me.

802
00:51:38,010 --> 00:51:38,670
Be quiet.

803
00:51:38,930 --> 00:51:40,450
I'm risking my life to save you.

804
00:51:41,170 --> 00:51:41,930
Hey, man, man.

805
00:51:42,750 --> 00:51:43,310
Sir!

806
00:51:49,470 --> 00:51:50,030
Min-jae.

807
00:51:50,310 --> 00:51:50,630
Let's go.

808
00:51:52,210 --> 00:51:53,130
Did something go wrong?

809
00:51:54,050 --> 00:51:54,870
This isn't the woman.

810
00:51:55,550 --> 00:51:55,690
What?

811
00:51:58,510 --> 00:52:01,410
No, I told you it was that ugly guy.

812
00:52:01,570 --> 00:52:02,150
It can't be.

813
00:52:02,430 --> 00:52:03,410
I saw him sitting there.

814
00:52:03,450 --> 00:52:04,990
I saw him sitting there.

815
00:52:05,270 --> 00:52:06,250
Tell me exactly.

816
00:52:07,070 --> 00:52:08,190
I think the rooms were switched.

817
00:52:08,690 --> 00:52:09,170
What do we do?

818
00:52:09,990 --> 00:52:11,290
We have to go back in and get him.

819
00:52:11,370 --> 00:52:12,590
We can't just search all the rooms.

820
00:52:13,050 --> 00:52:14,510
You said there was a side door behind the emergency room, right?

821
00:52:14,670 --> 00:52:16,190
No, there are always people there.

822
00:52:17,790 --> 00:52:20,510
Hey, there's an order in front of the emergency room.

823
00:52:21,050 --> 00:52:21,530
Hey, what?

824
00:52:21,830 --> 00:52:22,250
Hey, hey, hey.

825
00:52:22,390 --> 00:52:22,770
Be quiet.

826
00:52:23,490 --> 00:52:24,830
Was there an order in front of the emergency room?

827
00:52:26,370 --> 00:52:27,330
Yes, definitely.

828
00:52:28,330 --> 00:52:29,210
We couldn't have come out.

829
00:52:30,210 --> 00:52:31,370
He must have gone back to his room.

830
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:37,140
Fine.

831
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:39,480
I'm going back in.

832
00:52:40,140 --> 00:52:40,780
Listen up.

833
00:52:41,980 --> 00:52:43,200
Gimbap and Parrot, follow me.

834
00:52:43,720 --> 00:52:46,040
Gimbap and I will go and get that woman from her room.

835
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:48,260
Parrot, you take care of the emergency room.

836
00:52:49,340 --> 00:52:49,480
Pardon?

837
00:52:49,740 --> 00:52:53,260
To distract the patrolmen, we have to go through the emergency room. You do something with the nurses in the meantime.

838
00:52:53,420 --> 00:52:54,120
No, what am I supposed to do?

839
00:52:54,140 --> 00:52:55,440
Seduce them or kill them, you figure it out.

840
00:52:55,760 --> 00:52:56,780
If we get caught, we're all dead.

841
00:52:56,940 --> 00:52:58,320
That's why I didn't want to come in the first place.

842
00:52:58,340 --> 00:53:00,060
Who was the one who came because he wanted 300 won?

843
00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:01,500
Shut up and distract them well.

844
00:53:02,120 --> 00:53:03,300
Distract them even if you have to throw a fit.

845
00:53:03,340 --> 00:53:03,520
Got it?

846
00:53:04,260 --> 00:53:05,020
If we get caught, we're all dead.

847
00:53:05,780 --> 00:53:06,040
Barefoot.

848
00:53:06,040 --> 00:53:07,340
Take off those clothes.

849
00:53:08,180 --> 00:53:09,620
Boss, what about this woman?

850
00:53:10,620 --> 00:53:11,340
Hold her.

851
00:53:18,870 --> 00:53:22,710
In the rainy street...

852
00:53:25,370 --> 00:53:26,490
Do we need to move her back to the emergency room?

853
00:53:27,390 --> 00:53:27,490
Pardon?

854
00:53:27,750 --> 00:53:28,710
My sister is gone.

855
00:53:29,510 --> 00:53:30,070
What, a gisaeng house?

856
00:53:30,330 --> 00:53:30,930
Why a gisaeng house?

857
00:53:31,990 --> 00:53:33,350
Chunsam, he's not a gangster.

858
00:53:34,150 --> 00:53:36,990
I'll go on my own, so don't follow me...

859
00:53:38,610 --> 00:53:39,890
That guy from Yeomcheon Bridge...

860
00:53:39,890 --> 00:53:41,210
What kind of teacher is that?

861
00:53:46,540 --> 00:53:49,400
He's the kind of guy who hates it when someone gets something without working for it.

862
00:53:54,646 --> 00:54:03,386
