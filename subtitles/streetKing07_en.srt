1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:01,540
Fine.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:03,800
I'm going back in.

3
00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:05,180
Listen up.

4
00:00:06,460 --> 00:00:07,580
Gimbap and Parrot, follow me.

5
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:10,460
Gimbap and I will go and get that woman from her room.

6
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:12,660
Parrot, you take care of the emergency room.

7
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:15,200
Boss, what about this woman?

8
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:17,180
Hold her.

10
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:20,680
This isn't good.

11
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:23,380
His temperature is dropping and his pulse is getting faster.

12
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:24,700
I'm moving him back to the emergency room.

13
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:26,820
Why is this guy so unstable?

14
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,140
I think he's going into secondary shock...

15
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:31,220
Dr. Wang, I need your help.

16
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:33,460
Dr. Wang?

17
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:35,020
Yes?

18
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:36,860
Yes.

19
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:00,900
She must be crazy!

20
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:01,300
What!

21
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,040
It's a fake, it's a fake!

22
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:04,540
What do we do!

23
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:06,940
Get her on the bed!

24
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:08,580
Get her on the bed!

25
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:09,860
This bitch!

26
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,060
Hurry up!

27
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:12,880
Kill her!

28
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:14,000
Kill her!

29
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:15,940
Stop it.

30
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:18,580
That's why we need to treat her quickly.

31
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,160
Calm down!

32
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:31,640
Where did he go?

33
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:33,160
He has nowhere to go!

34
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:34,580
Where did he go?

35
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,120
Call the discharge office, quickly!

36
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:37,940
This guy's going to crack his head open!

37
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:38,280
Quickly!

38
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,320
Call!

39
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:41,780
Call!

40
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:59,960
An epilepsy patient came in on his own.

41
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:02,580
Just give him about 2mm of Valium first.

42
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,720
We tried that, but it's not working well.

43
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:05,980
Give him 2mm more.

44
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:06,780
Yes, understood.

45
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:10,920
Man, it's been a long time.

46
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:21,920
What... what is it?

47
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:28,630
Get him in, get him in quick.

48
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:30,370
What about the stupid woman?

49
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:31,770
Tell her to go alone.

50
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:32,610
Yeah, she says she's going.

51
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:36,330
Idiot, what about Parrot?

52
00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:38,030
He's taking care of things, he'll be out soon.

53
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:39,890
Hey guys!

54
00:03:41,690 --> 00:03:43,210
Give me a piggyback ride.

55
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:50,060
Hye-wol's room is over there.

56
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:53,500
The party won't be over for a while. What should we do?

57
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:55,540
There's nothing to worry about.

58
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:58,060
I'll wait until the night is over.

59
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:01,360
Then shall I keep you company?

60
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:04,860
There's no need to waste time.

61
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:07,940
I'm not a bee that lands on just any flower.

62
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,500
Who asked you to touch me?

63
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:13,060
I just offered to be your companion.

64
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,800
Just take the gift and leave.

65
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:49,420
This is disgustingly delicious.

66
00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:24,930
Hey, you, Gimbap.

67
00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:27,050
Get him inside before anyone sees.

68
00:06:27,410 --> 00:06:27,810
Hey, Hama.

69
00:06:28,090 --> 00:06:28,150
Yes.

70
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:30,170
Left Foot.

71
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:31,170
Burn it.

72
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:33,210
Hey, where did Raccoon go?

73
00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:34,110
Raccoon!

74
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:37,790
Thank you.

75
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:39,910
You saved both of our lives.

76
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:44,350
Money isn't important, but this debt I will never...

77
00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:45,210
Money is important.

78
00:06:46,850 --> 00:06:48,190
I'll try to get it as soon as possible.

79
00:06:48,970 --> 00:06:50,070
Let's just save him first.

80
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:54,510
The Boss is a strange person.

81
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:56,890
He's not a philosopher, nor a revolutionary.

82
00:06:56,970 --> 00:06:59,330
Let's talk about the complicated stuff later, just take him inside.

83
00:06:59,950 --> 00:07:00,670
Hey, Raccoon!

84
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:06,030
Hey, where did Raccoon go?

85
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:06,690
Boss.

86
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:10,890
Um, my sister is gone.

87
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:12,870
Where did she go?

88
00:07:13,410 --> 00:07:14,370
Where could she have gone besides home?

89
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:14,990
She'll be back soon.

90
00:07:15,010 --> 00:07:16,270
No, Boss.

91
00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:20,050
I think she went to cause trouble...

92
00:07:20,050 --> 00:07:21,810
Something must have happened.

93
00:07:22,130 --> 00:07:22,230
Huh?

94
00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:23,310
What happened?

95
00:07:23,890 --> 00:07:26,270
Hey, don't just stand there making me frustrated, tell me quickly.

96
00:07:26,450 --> 00:07:27,130
What happened?

97
00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:30,610
She must have gone to the gisaeng house.

98
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:31,470
What, the gisaeng house?

99
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:32,310
Why the gisaeng house?

100
00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:34,550
You tell me, man.

101
00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:40,710
Well, earlier today...

102
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:43,970
I mentioned the gisaeng.

103
00:07:45,490 --> 00:07:47,330
Hey, I told you to guard the shack well.

104
00:07:47,330 --> 00:07:49,070
Hey, Raccoon, what were you doing?

105
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:51,350
Hey, the shack is fine.

106
00:07:51,670 --> 00:07:53,990
It's just that Crow has lost her mind.

107
00:07:54,710 --> 00:07:56,410
Hey, you two, guard them well.

108
00:07:57,350 --> 00:07:58,650
The Boss is mine.

109
00:07:59,690 --> 00:08:01,110
Boss, Boss.

110
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:13,880
I've been waiting for three hours today.

111
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:17,060
I never asked you to wait.

112
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:24,240
For a busy man like me, three hours is like several days for an ordinary person.

113
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,080
Do you have any idea how much I've invested in you?

114
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:33,620
I hope that today was worth the wait.

115
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:34,920
Well...

116
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:38,100
I'm sorry, but I don't think it will be.

117
00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:51,270
Joseon women may not have the gentle charm of Japanese women, but they have a sharp, witty appeal that I quite like.

118
00:08:52,890 --> 00:08:53,950
Please leave.

119
00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:55,690
Hey.

120
00:08:56,030 --> 00:08:57,130
What are you doing?

121
00:08:57,410 --> 00:08:58,030
Haewol.

122
00:08:58,210 --> 00:08:58,650
Let go.

123
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:00,290
Do you know how long I've waited for you?

124
00:09:01,010 --> 00:09:01,390
Let go.

125
00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:02,850
What are you doing?

126
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:08,280
You insolent wench.

127
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,440
How dare you do this to me?

128
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:18,760
Hey.

129
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:19,480
Let go.

130
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:20,100
Let go.

131
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:41,500
No, Chunsam.

132
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:44,240
Stop.

133
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:47,440
Stop right there.

134
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:51,900
Stop.

135
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:54,880
No.

136
00:09:58,140 --> 00:09:59,480
No.

137
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:10,080
Chunsam.

138
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:11,440
Chunsam.

139
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:16,060
Stop it.

140
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:16,960
Stop it.

141
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:17,740
No.

142
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:18,260
Stop it.

143
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:19,080
Stop it.

144
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,060
That bastard deserves to die.

145
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:20,500
He deserves to die.

146
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:22,940
Stop it.

147
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:24,860
Yeon-hee.

148
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:25,440
Are you okay?

149
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:28,320
I'm fine.

150
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:31,520
Chunsam.

151
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:32,300
You're bleeding.

152
00:10:40,990 --> 00:10:41,910
Yeon-hee.

153
00:10:42,190 --> 00:10:44,990
I'll kill anyone who lays a hand on Yeon-hee.

154
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:47,010
Let's go.

155
00:11:06,590 --> 00:11:07,170
Forward.

156
00:11:08,090 --> 00:11:09,010
Do you want to go home?

157
00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:09,330
Yes.

158
00:11:09,830 --> 00:11:10,590
There's no one here.

159
00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:15,770
Pardon?

160
00:11:17,690 --> 00:11:18,270
A Japanese guy.

161
00:11:18,530 --> 00:11:18,830
A Japanese guy.

162
00:11:20,890 --> 00:11:21,770
This is a big problem.

163
00:11:21,970 --> 00:11:23,350
It's not a big problem at all.

164
00:11:24,010 --> 00:11:25,590
I just poked him a little.

165
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:27,250
Don't you know?

166
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:27,610
Don't you know?

167
00:11:28,930 --> 00:11:30,110
He's following us again.

168
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:38,670
Hey, do you know what the hardest thing in the world is?

169
00:11:39,570 --> 00:11:42,830
The hardest thing in the world is a human head.

170
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:46,070
I don't know who made it, but it's really hard.

171
00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:48,990
Hurry, hurry, hurry.

172
00:11:49,830 --> 00:11:51,430
How can we live here?

173
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:54,590
It's so cold in here.

174
00:11:55,550 --> 00:11:56,430
It's okay.

175
00:11:56,730 --> 00:11:57,490
It's okay.

176
00:11:58,390 --> 00:11:59,270
Boss.

177
00:11:59,730 --> 00:12:00,090
Boss.

178
00:12:00,090 --> 00:12:04,010
If you sleep here until dawn, you'll be a frozen pollack.

179
00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:05,090
Hey, Grasshopper.

180
00:12:05,210 --> 00:12:14,230
If it freezes, it becomes a frozen pollack. If it thaws, it becomes a dried pollack. If you starve for a few days, it becomes a dried pollack. That's how all beggars live.

181
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:35,320
Rain.

182
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:37,820
Rain.

183
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:39,240
Rain.

184
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:45,440
In the rainy street

185
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:53,680
In the lonely street

186
00:12:56,780 --> 00:13:07,500
How can I forget those old days when you made me cry and left?

187
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:27,610
They broke Min-jae out of the hospital.

188
00:13:27,970 --> 00:13:29,350
With the help of the people here.

189
00:13:30,630 --> 00:13:32,150
Where is this?

190
00:13:33,190 --> 00:13:34,070
Under the Yeomcheon Bridge.

191
00:13:35,970 --> 00:13:36,650
A slum?

192
00:13:38,170 --> 00:13:39,630
It's worse than that.

193
00:13:40,410 --> 00:13:41,210
It's a beggar's shack.

194
00:13:42,270 --> 00:13:43,030
Don't worry.

195
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:44,910
I'll take you somewhere else.

196
00:13:45,530 --> 00:13:46,390
To a comfortable and safe place.

197
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:47,850
You can get treatment there.

198
00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:49,430
I'm fine.

199
00:13:49,430 --> 00:13:53,390
Yes... it doesn't matter where I am.

200
00:13:54,350 --> 00:13:57,590
As long as we can be together like this...

201
00:13:59,610 --> 00:14:01,830
It doesn't matter where I am.

202
00:14:02,310 --> 00:14:05,610
As long as we can be together like this...

203
00:14:05,610 --> 00:14:06,190
You crazy fool!

204
00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:08,770
Stop rubbing your face all over the floor!

205
00:14:11,590 --> 00:14:17,730
When a bride and groom meet after a long time, we have to see if sparks fly or if it's just a dud, you beggar punks.

206
00:14:17,730 --> 00:14:20,370
The young master is setting the mood, why don't you come over here?

207
00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:22,190
You sickly beggar punks!

208
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:22,790
Hurry, hurry!

209
00:14:23,650 --> 00:14:25,830
Or I'll break your legs!

210
00:14:25,930 --> 00:14:26,030
Hurry!

211
00:14:26,670 --> 00:14:27,330
Hey, hurry!

212
00:14:27,710 --> 00:14:28,190
You go too!

213
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:30,890
No, now... now...

214
00:14:30,890 --> 00:14:32,030
You go too!

215
00:14:34,770 --> 00:14:35,410
Eat.

216
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:36,390
It's a calming pill.

217
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:37,510
It's okay.

218
00:14:37,890 --> 00:14:38,130
Why?

219
00:14:39,210 --> 00:14:40,790
You take that when you're scared.

220
00:14:41,830 --> 00:14:44,630
I'm not scared right now, I'm angry and frustrated.

221
00:14:45,690 --> 00:14:49,550
I'm angry that I was born a woman, and frustrated that I have to keep living as a woman.

222
00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:54,450
Why were women created to be so pathetic?

223
00:14:55,430 --> 00:14:56,910
We don't have the strength to protect our own bodies.

224
00:14:57,370 --> 00:14:58,290
But you're pretty.

225
00:14:58,850 --> 00:15:00,250
Not rough and tough like men.

226
00:15:01,170 --> 00:15:02,810
It's just a shame that you're a little weak.

227
00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:10,290
Even though we're in the same boat, it's cheap to think of using your face as a weapon against men.

228
00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:12,290
That's all we have.

229
00:15:12,290 --> 00:15:17,050
Hey, if a pretty girl wags her tail and seduces a man,

230
00:15:17,130 --> 00:15:18,790
even the strongest man will fall for it.

231
00:15:20,530 --> 00:15:27,450
If I were just a little prettier, I could have a man among men like Du-han in the palm of my hand...

232
00:15:27,450 --> 00:15:31,350
You should never expect true love from people who live by their fists.

233
00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:33,270
You'll only get hurt.

234
00:15:33,790 --> 00:15:36,470
Kim Chunsam is a gangster who hangs out with Du-han.

235
00:15:36,590 --> 00:15:37,690
Chunsam is not a gangster.

236
00:15:38,970 --> 00:15:42,770
Do you think I'd be seeing him if he were the kind of person who just goes around swinging his fists for fun?

237
00:15:43,590 --> 00:15:46,310
But I really don't know if that person is a human or a ghost.

238
00:15:46,990 --> 00:15:50,990
He got hit in the head with a shovel and was bleeding, but he didn't even flinch.

239
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:53,930
What's going to happen to him now?

240
00:15:55,170 --> 00:15:58,470
The police are searching Gyeongseong like a flea comb. He's bound to get caught.

241
00:15:59,950 --> 00:16:00,750
What do we do?

242
00:16:02,450 --> 00:16:03,150
I don't know.

243
00:16:04,210 --> 00:16:04,810
Let's go in.

244
00:16:16,570 --> 00:16:17,790
Hey, what's this?

245
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:19,110
Hey, what's wrong, Ae-sim?

246
00:16:22,370 --> 00:16:23,130
Mom!

247
00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:28,290
Hey, I should call a servant from the main house to beat them and kick them out.

248
00:16:28,390 --> 00:16:28,930
Wait a minute.

249
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:49,780
You must have been very hungry.

250
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:57,600
Still, you shouldn't just barge into someone else's house.

251
00:16:58,300 --> 00:16:59,160
Don't do it again.

252
00:16:59,540 --> 00:16:59,540
Okay?

253
00:17:06,810 --> 00:17:09,210
Here, take this and eat it.

254
00:17:11,090 --> 00:17:11,590
Take it.

255
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:14,590
Hmm?

256
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:28,680
You mean girl.

257
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:35,180
She's so pretty, even the Boss must have fallen for her.

258
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:38,480
A girl like me is not even a woman, nothing.

259
00:17:58,900 --> 00:17:59,740
Hey.

260
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:02,020
Hey.

261
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:05,680
Where have you been?

262
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:06,960
Do you know how long I've been looking for you?

263
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:09,040
Who told you to wait for me here all night?

264
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:11,080
Let's go inside.

265
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:14,040
I told you not to wait for me there all night...

266
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:16,880
What's wrong with you?

267
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:18,820
Have you been drinking?

268
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:20,720
You idiot.

269
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:23,240
You and I are both idiots, you idiot.

270
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:26,600
What are you talking about, coming in drunk in the middle of the night?

271
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:31,700
Just as the Boss doesn't even sniff at me no matter how much I bark, do you think I'll even bat an eye if you throw a fit?

272
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:35,320
You fool.

273
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:37,820
What's so great about an idiot like me?

274
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:41,520
Crow, you know.

275
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:46,520
To me, you are a longing.

276
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:49,800
We live together in the same shack every day, so what's there to miss?

277
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,300
I don't want to be your longing.

278
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:52,880
How can I not miss you?

279
00:18:54,040 --> 00:19:04,120
I see you staring at the Boss every day until your eyes pop out like a toad's. Just thinking about you breaks my heart.

280
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:06,660
I'm a person too.

281
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:11,420
Once in a while, for a change of pace, look at me too.

282
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:12,800
You fool.

283
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:17,760
I can live without eating, but I can't live a single day without thinking about the Boss.

284
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:21,880
If the Boss marries another woman...

285
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:23,940
Do you think I'll just stand by?

286
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:25,980
I'll kill those women, kill the Boss, and then kill myself.

287
00:19:34,530 --> 00:19:39,270
Even if you marry another man, I can't kill you.

288
00:19:40,570 --> 00:19:44,170
How could I kill someone as fragile as a blade of grass?

289
00:19:46,690 --> 00:19:49,490
It's better for me to die alone.

290
00:20:17,810 --> 00:20:20,610
Police, police, police... what, are you looking for the police?

291
00:20:22,590 --> 00:20:23,390
What about the examination hall?

292
00:20:23,470 --> 00:20:23,810
How is it?

293
00:20:23,810 --> 00:20:24,950
I went out, I went out, I went out.

294
00:20:24,970 --> 00:20:25,750
I don't know, I don't know.

295
00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:29,230
But Boss, this isn't a safe place.

296
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:33,650
Hey, this looks really delicious.

297
00:20:42,130 --> 00:20:43,130
Welcome.

298
00:20:44,090 --> 00:20:44,710
Are you Yoomyungdo?

299
00:20:46,850 --> 00:20:47,590
Yes, that's right.

300
00:20:47,850 --> 00:20:48,170
Follow me.

301
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:50,870
No, I need to know what's going on before I can go.

302
00:20:53,370 --> 00:20:54,490
Hey, what's wrong?

303
00:20:54,710 --> 00:20:55,230
Sir.

304
00:20:55,850 --> 00:20:56,870
Just watch the store.

305
00:20:57,010 --> 00:20:57,970
Get that rope, you bastard.

306
00:20:58,350 --> 00:20:59,710
No, so...

307
00:21:00,570 --> 00:21:01,750
Did you sell a lot?

308
00:21:04,330 --> 00:21:04,890
What?

309
00:21:09,210 --> 00:21:12,010
Didn't I tell you to just go on your own and not follow me?

310
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:29,860
There's a gisaeng who saw you two come in together, yet you keep playing dumb.

311
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:34,740
Just a guy you met on the street and had a drink with? Who is he and what does he do?

312
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:38,320
Even if you're close, if you don't know, you don't know.

313
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:40,100
I get that you didn't see him and don't know him.

314
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:41,740
Hey, tell me.

315
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:43,660
Who is he and what does he do?

316
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:46,900
You have to untie him to make him talk.

317
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:48,880
Tell me.

318
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:51,780
I am...

319
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:56,960
Fine.

320
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:00,920
Is the teacher outside?

321
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:02,420
Teacher.

322
00:22:51,130 --> 00:22:51,810
Why?

323
00:23:01,050 --> 00:23:01,730
Sir.

324
00:23:03,230 --> 00:23:08,750
I don't know anything, but I'm innocent.

325
00:23:09,530 --> 00:23:13,050
My only crime is working hard to make a living.

326
00:23:13,250 --> 00:23:15,290
But why are you doing this?

327
00:23:18,850 --> 00:23:21,770
I pay my taxes well.

328
00:23:21,770 --> 00:23:25,130
I'm good to the police and I'm a first-class citizen of the Japanese Empire.

329
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:01,300
I have something to tell you.

330
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:02,660
So cooperate.

331
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:03,800
Who is that guy?

332
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:05,420
I don't even know who he is.

333
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:08,060
I told you, he's just some beggar I met on the street.

334
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:09,520
A beggar?

335
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:11,320
That guy is a beggar?

336
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:15,820
I'm not saying he's really a beggar, I'm saying his clothes are like a beggar's.

337
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:16,940
That's right.

338
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:19,660
His clothes are like a beggar's and he looks like a beggar.

339
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:20,960
Tell me clearly.

340
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:22,140
Is that guy a beggar or not?

341
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:23,120
I'm telling you the truth.

342
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:24,940
I'm telling you, he's a real beggar.

343
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:27,200
I'm telling you, I only know how to make money.

344
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:29,300
Ask the beggars at Yeomcheon Bridge about him.

345
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:29,800
Jeong-don.

346
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:30,160
Sir.

347
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:35,040
That guy from Yeomcheon Bridge?

348
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:36,040
Yes.

349
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:37,440
It seems certain.

350
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:41,260
You've been through a lot.

351
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:48,480
I was already having a headache because of the Sung Min-jae escape incident, and now this has made things very difficult.

352
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:52,220
The situation is very bad, isn't it?

353
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:52,660
Good.

354
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:53,080
Good.

355
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:56,180
When things get this complicated, you're bound to meet in one place.

356
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:59,560
Somehow, this incident is definitely related to the attempted assassination of Superintendent Endo.

357
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:00,360
I have a feeling.

358
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:00,900
No, then...

359
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:01,160
No.

360
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:01,360
No.

361
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:02,000
Don't ask why.

362
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:02,860
I don't know either.

363
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:05,520
Where is the teacher?

364
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:05,860
Sir.

365
00:25:08,620 --> 00:25:09,840
Singers are connected to each other.

366
00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:12,020
If you dig deep enough, you'll find what you're looking for.

367
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:13,500
What should we do with that guy?

368
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:13,900
Let him go.

369
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:15,140
He's said what he needs to say.

370
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:16,000
Put a tail on him.

371
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:17,300
I'll tail him myself...

372
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:18,400
Sir.

373
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:18,840
Sir.

374
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:25,940
Hey, you punk.

375
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:27,180
Is that girl that great?

376
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:32,120
A woman is medicine if you like her in moderation, but she's poison if you fall too hard.

377
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:34,420
You stupid fool.

378
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:35,940
You're going to ruin your life.

379
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:39,420
Do you have any hammers in your shop?

380
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:41,140
You'd have to go to a hardware store for that.

381
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:43,020
Get me one.

382
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:43,740
What for?

383
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:46,740
To nail your mouth shut.

384
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:49,440
You're a man, but you get scared by a little threat like that.

385
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:52,200
It's not that I wanted to tell him, it just came out...

386
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:53,000
What do you mean, you didn't know?

387
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:53,860
You're the one who told him everything.

388
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:56,480
Even if I hadn't told him, they would have found out soon enough.

389
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:59,880
Even so, is it the same as them finding out from somewhere else?

390
00:26:00,180 --> 00:26:00,840
You're his friend.

391
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:02,840
Friend?

392
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:08,080
I can pretend to die for a friend, but I can't actually die.

393
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:12,980
If you can't actually die, then friend or not, it's nothing.

394
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:16,060
I can't do it.

395
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:20,720
If I had two or three lives, maybe, but I only have one.

396
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:21,540
I can't do it.

397
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:22,860
Right.

398
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:26,560
Then cherish your one and only life.

399
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:27,860
Before someone takes it from you.

400
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:30,780
Hey, you bastard!

401
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:31,860
Aren't you going too far?

402
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:32,560
That's enough!

403
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:33,360
Find Jun-seo!

404
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:35,840
We have to find him before the police do!

405
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:38,320
We have to find him quickly and send him to some remote place.

406
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:40,520
We can't let him spend his youth in prison.

407
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:42,220
You beggar-like bastard!

408
00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:42,660
Oh my!

409
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:49,260
I told you, Han-young.

410
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:56,640
Love was supposed to make us stronger.

411
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:02,820
But I guess that's not it.

412
00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:12,120
I thought so when we were together.

413
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:22,500
But now that I'm alone, I feel myself getting weaker.

414
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:24,440
I'm sorry.

415
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:27,380
I ran away by myself, didn't I?

416
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:30,400
No, Han-young.

417
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:35,440
That's not what I meant...

418
00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:37,940
That will never happen.

419
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:40,400
We'll always be together.

420
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:45,780
In life and in death.

421
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:53,200
Hey!

422
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:55,620
Aren't you guys worried?

423
00:27:55,960 --> 00:28:00,960
You don't even know if the Boss who saved your lives is dead or alive, and you're just sitting here holding hands and chatting?

424
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:06,160
How do you know so well what men and women do when they meet?

425
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:08,160
I guess you're a woman too, sis.

426
00:28:08,260 --> 00:28:09,040
Seeing you get jealous.

427
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:09,900
Shut up!

428
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,560
Wait, what happened?

429
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:14,460
Didn't he get caught by a robber, beaten up, and die?

430
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:16,100
Have you ever seen a robber do that?

431
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:18,440
When it's dark, you can't tell if it's a beggar or something else.

432
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:19,600
Don't be ridiculous.

433
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:21,100
He'd get robbed trying to rob the Boss.

434
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:22,480
He'd die, he'd die.

435
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:22,920
Hey!

436
00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:24,700
They're here again.

437
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:28,140
Is your leader in there?

438
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:28,900
He's not here.

439
00:28:29,060 --> 00:28:29,360
Yes.

440
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:31,700
He's really not here.

441
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:33,660
We've been looking for him all night.

442
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:34,500
All night.

443
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:40,000
There's only bedbugs and rat droppings here.

444
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:40,660
There's nothing here.

445
00:29:08,270 --> 00:29:09,910
Our bean paste...

446
00:29:11,570 --> 00:29:12,610
No meat either?

447
00:29:12,850 --> 00:29:12,970
No.

448
00:29:15,150 --> 00:29:15,970
There's nothing.

449
00:29:17,650 --> 00:29:19,030
Did you search everywhere?

450
00:29:19,410 --> 00:29:19,550
Yes.

451
00:29:19,910 --> 00:29:21,420
I've searched everywhere, even the bean paste pot...

452
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:32,340
You really don't know where your leader is?

453
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:34,960
That's right.

454
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:37,540
We really don't know right now.

455
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:39,540
Don't say you don't know even if you do.

456
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:40,500
Who do you think I am?

457
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:42,460
You'll have to search the bean paste pot carefully.

458
00:29:42,540 --> 00:29:43,340
If you're so pure...

459
00:29:48,290 --> 00:29:49,790
Bring those two.

460
00:29:49,890 --> 00:29:49,970
Yes.

461
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:52,530
No!

462
00:29:52,970 --> 00:29:53,470
No!

463
00:29:53,970 --> 00:29:54,370
Let go!

464
00:29:58,170 --> 00:29:58,970
Let go!

465
00:29:59,590 --> 00:29:59,590
Let go!

466
00:29:59,610 --> 00:29:59,970
Let go!

467
00:30:00,150 --> 00:30:00,630
Let go!

468
00:30:00,630 --> 00:30:00,830
Let go!

469
00:30:01,490 --> 00:30:01,710
Let go!

470
00:30:01,730 --> 00:30:01,730
Let go!

471
00:30:01,970 --> 00:30:01,970
Let go!

472
00:30:02,370 --> 00:30:02,770
Let go!

473
00:30:02,830 --> 00:30:03,330
Let go!

474
00:30:03,430 --> 00:30:03,710
Let go!

475
00:30:03,890 --> 00:30:04,150
Let go!

476
00:30:06,490 --> 00:30:07,290
Let go!

477
00:30:07,290 --> 00:30:08,090
Let go!

478
00:30:08,090 --> 00:30:08,430
Let go!

479
00:30:08,430 --> 00:30:09,010
Let go!

480
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:24,160
Let go!

481
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:24,620
Do-yeon.

482
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:27,360
Do-yeon.

483
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:28,100
Hama.

484
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:33,040
Gan-hee.

485
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:33,840
Do-yeon.

486
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:35,560
How did you know there was a doggy door here?

487
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:37,800
Min-jae.

488
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:38,840
Min-jae.

489
00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:40,720
Hey, Hama, this is bad.

490
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:42,720
Can you get a rickshaw?

491
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:40,420
Violence is not something to be used on people.

492
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,540
How much it must have hurt.

493
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:50,100
Even after being hurt like this, are you still not going to tell me where your Boss is?

494
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:52,940
We don't know.

495
00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:56,420
How can we tell you what we don't know?

496
00:31:56,660 --> 00:31:58,760
If you knew, you would have told me already.

497
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:00,260
It's true.

498
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:02,960
I really hate violence, but...

499
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:06,640
When this is the only way, there's no other choice.

500
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:09,120
Excuse me.

501
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:12,340
We might die anyway.

502
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:13,840
What kind of teacher is that?

503
00:32:14,620 --> 00:32:19,860
Unlike others, we haven't lost our teeth, so our jaw muscles are weak.

504
00:32:20,180 --> 00:32:20,600
Sir.

505
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:21,680
Yes.

506
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:16,400
Just being pretty and knowing how to pour drinks doesn't make you a gisaeng.

507
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:24,700
You have to smile in front of a customer who wants to laugh, and you have to cry in front of a customer who wants to see tears.

508
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:30,080
How dare you be rude to a customer you don't like?

509
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:34,520
Do you know the difference between a woman and a gisaeng?

510
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:43,960
A woman must be a person before she is a woman, and a gisaeng must be a woman before she is a person.

511
00:33:45,540 --> 00:33:50,560
While you're a gisaeng, you have to throw away all the pride that ordinary people have.

512
00:33:53,820 --> 00:34:00,720
There's a girl among you who, because of her pride, refuses to lower herself in front of men.

513
00:34:03,340 --> 00:34:10,480
Keep that nature well hidden, and take it out again when you quit being a gisaeng and go back to being a woman.

514
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:16,180
Everyone, leave. Haewol, you stay.

515
00:34:34,710 --> 00:34:38,390
You said you'd only be a gisaeng until you're twenty-two, right?

516
00:34:39,490 --> 00:34:40,410
Yes.

517
00:34:41,450 --> 00:34:41,670
Why?

518
00:34:43,530 --> 00:34:50,870
By then, my younger siblings will be able to take care of themselves, and after that, I want to live for myself.

519
00:34:52,850 --> 00:34:57,730
You're a very smart girl to be planning your life at such a young age.

520
00:35:01,350 --> 00:35:08,450
But your plan requires you to earn a lot of money in a short period of time...

521
00:35:08,450 --> 00:35:11,890
What will happen if every customer who sees you turns their back on you?

522
00:35:13,670 --> 00:35:15,110
What are you talking about?

523
00:35:16,350 --> 00:35:18,190
I'm talking about Director Ikeda.

524
00:35:19,310 --> 00:35:21,750
You haven't even visited him once, have you?

525
00:35:23,910 --> 00:35:27,210
You know that Director Ikeda is the Governor-General's nephew, right?

526
00:35:28,910 --> 00:35:33,510
From now on, the people from the Governor-General's office won't be pleased with you.

527
00:35:33,810 --> 00:35:34,530
I don't care.

528
00:35:35,250 --> 00:35:36,590
I'm not pleased with him either.

529
00:35:36,770 --> 00:35:40,890
It's a crude expression, but there's a difference between scary and dirty.

530
00:35:42,690 --> 00:35:49,370
Even if I starve to death and my family ends up on the street, I can't go visit that man.

531
00:35:51,590 --> 00:35:53,770
Madam, someone's here to see you.

532
00:35:57,210 --> 00:35:58,570
You can't come in here.

533
00:35:59,790 --> 00:36:02,210
Madam, that person just came in without thinking...

534
00:36:22,770 --> 00:36:23,530
No.

535
00:36:24,690 --> 00:36:29,130
This will be the first and last time I ask or demand anything of you.

536
00:36:30,350 --> 00:36:31,470
I won't do this again.

537
00:36:33,070 --> 00:36:34,270
Don't say that.

538
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:36,770
It's been so long.

539
00:36:38,570 --> 00:36:41,150
I'm so happy that you came to see me.

540
00:36:42,490 --> 00:36:43,250
Really?

541
00:36:43,250 --> 00:36:49,270
I was so surprised when I heard you ran away from home.

542
00:36:50,150 --> 00:36:53,350
From the person who left her eight-year-old child in that house and walked away?

543
00:36:53,890 --> 00:36:55,550
That was all for you...

544
00:36:55,550 --> 00:36:56,490
It was for me, wasn't it?

545
00:36:57,570 --> 00:37:07,210
There was no thought for you, who lived as you pleased after leaving me behind. It was all for your young son from beginning to end, right?

546
00:37:08,150 --> 00:37:10,530
I thought you would be happy in that house.

547
00:37:11,550 --> 00:37:14,530
The things I couldn't give you, your father...

548
00:37:14,530 --> 00:37:15,090
Stop it!

549
00:37:16,250 --> 00:37:18,850
The news that you were growing up well.

550
00:37:20,370 --> 00:37:26,190
The news that you had become a respectable student at Gyeongseong Medical School. I wanted to run to you more than a dozen times.

551
00:37:27,650 --> 00:37:29,330
This mother has spent her whole life...

552
00:37:29,330 --> 00:37:30,530
I don't plan on staying long.

553
00:37:32,070 --> 00:37:36,970
As soon as I get a message from Shanghai and Min-jae's body has recovered enough, I'll take him away immediately.

554
00:37:39,350 --> 00:37:41,090
Don't worry.

555
00:37:42,030 --> 00:37:44,590
I'll take care of him with all my strength.

556
00:37:46,210 --> 00:37:47,350
He's precious to me.

557
00:37:48,630 --> 00:37:55,670
He's a comrade, a teacher, and like a mother to me. He's a very precious person, more than you can imagine.

558
00:37:57,850 --> 00:37:58,490
Han-young.

559
00:38:00,630 --> 00:38:01,590
Han-young.

560
00:38:03,230 --> 00:38:05,530
Can't you call me 'mother' just once?

561
00:38:06,710 --> 00:38:16,030
When you sold me to the Lee family of Samcheong-dong 14 years ago, my mother died.

562
00:38:45,130 --> 00:38:46,730
Go out first.

563
00:38:47,090 --> 00:38:47,250
Yes.

564
00:38:49,350 --> 00:38:51,910
The madam told me to give you this.

565
00:39:05,250 --> 00:39:06,930
I'm only taking 300 won.

566
00:39:07,610 --> 00:39:08,290
Please return the rest.

567
00:39:10,470 --> 00:39:11,530
Um...

568
00:39:13,110 --> 00:39:15,710
Do you know where Chunsam is right now?

569
00:39:17,750 --> 00:39:18,810
Chunsam...

570
00:39:18,810 --> 00:39:19,590
You know the Boss?

571
00:39:22,190 --> 00:39:27,290
Then maybe the one who gave the Boss the Yi Sang poetry collection...

572
00:39:29,150 --> 00:39:30,150
Yes...

573
00:39:31,290 --> 00:39:33,170
Could I possibly meet him?

574
00:39:35,030 --> 00:39:39,050
Everyone at the shack is worried, but we don't have any news.

575
00:39:41,230 --> 00:39:41,990
What should I do?

576
00:39:42,430 --> 00:39:43,750
He's badly hurt.

577
00:39:44,550 --> 00:39:47,390
He won't be safe if he's caught by the patrolmen.

578
00:39:48,290 --> 00:39:49,170
Don't worry too much.

579
00:39:49,850 --> 00:39:52,630
The Boss is not someone who will go down easily.

580
00:40:02,620 --> 00:40:05,340
How can two women be so different?

581
00:40:05,340 --> 00:40:11,340
Just as there are different sizes of loaches, from as big as an adult's finger to tiny ones, I guess all women are the same.

582
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:17,420
I'm sure my eyes are covered not with pollack skin, but with something thicker, like pig skin.

583
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:20,960
What should I do? I find Crow a thousand times prettier than that woman.

584
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:23,260
That's what happens when you like someone.

585
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:26,800
This is a hospital where one of two has to die to be cured.

586
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:29,480
Crow...

587
00:40:40,350 --> 00:40:41,350
Yes.

588
00:40:42,670 --> 00:40:43,950
You've been through a lot of trouble.

589
00:40:45,150 --> 00:40:45,510
Not at all.

590
00:40:48,410 --> 00:40:51,110
There are always a lot of people behind me.

591
00:40:52,250 --> 00:40:54,530
Many women, many men.

592
00:40:55,750 --> 00:40:58,770
But there are very few people I can ask for help.

593
00:41:00,950 --> 00:41:08,390
People are the most precious thing to people, but it's all because I lack virtue.

594
00:41:10,610 --> 00:41:13,190
Just tell me what I can do.

595
00:41:14,070 --> 00:41:15,510
I'll help in any way I can.

596
00:41:17,870 --> 00:41:20,330
Even if I suspect something, I won't tell anyone.

597
00:41:20,850 --> 00:41:21,950
Don't worry.

598
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:34,880
I'm sorry.

599
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:39,200
Who are you?

600
00:41:39,820 --> 00:41:40,520
Don't worry.

601
00:41:41,940 --> 00:41:43,260
Han-young...

602
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:45,380
He went back to Yeomcheon Bridge.

603
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:47,720
He'll be safe there, so don't worry too much.

604
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:50,280
Where am I?

605
00:41:53,300 --> 00:41:55,500
You should have some porridge...

606
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:58,520
What kind of place is this?

607
00:42:03,030 --> 00:42:03,510
It's a gisaeng house.

608
00:42:04,370 --> 00:42:06,290
And I'm a gisaeng who works in this house.

609
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:11,640
Everyone has their own way of living.

610
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:15,760
A noble lady, a servant girl, or a gisaeng...

611
00:42:17,780 --> 00:42:24,180
Like it or not, I think it's better to sing and dance than to be dragged away as a comfort woman.

612
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:30,880
Am I making things difficult for you by asking unnecessary questions?

613
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:32,000
No.

614
00:42:33,660 --> 00:42:35,190
Actually, I'm envious.

615
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:43,060
To dedicate your life to something more precious than just making a living, and also...

616
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:45,520
Pardon?

617
00:42:48,020 --> 00:42:52,320
I'm envious that you can do the same work as the person you love.

618
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:57,140
How do you know Han-young?

619
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:00,520
I know someone at Yeomcheon Church.

620
00:43:01,780 --> 00:43:02,480
Yeomcheon Church?

621
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:04,680
Yes.

622
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:08,680
Someone you like?

623
00:43:11,460 --> 00:43:12,320
Yes.

624
00:43:17,890 --> 00:43:18,470
It's funny, isn't it?

625
00:43:19,190 --> 00:43:20,490
A gisaeng meeting a beggar.

626
00:43:21,750 --> 00:43:22,830
No.

627
00:43:23,650 --> 00:43:24,530
What's so funny about it?

628
00:43:25,130 --> 00:43:27,130
Can you understand?

629
00:43:29,310 --> 00:43:30,470
Of course.

630
00:43:31,030 --> 00:43:36,770
If it's true love, it doesn't matter what the man does for a living.

631
00:43:38,090 --> 00:43:41,650
But it is a bit special.

632
00:43:43,630 --> 00:43:46,230
That Anchovy punk is finished.

633
00:43:46,790 --> 00:43:49,730
With the police all over the place, it's only a matter of time before he's caught, right?

634
00:43:50,470 --> 00:43:53,130
You're going to get a windfall without even lifting a finger, sir.

635
00:43:53,130 --> 00:43:56,510
The police are going to take care of that thorn in your side, Anchovy.

636
00:43:58,970 --> 00:44:01,470
I thought you would be happy, sir.

637
00:44:03,470 --> 00:44:04,070
What do you mean?

638
00:44:04,830 --> 00:44:09,550
You hated Anchovy so much that you were always waiting for something bad to happen to him.

639
00:44:12,230 --> 00:44:13,030
Why would I?

640
00:44:21,650 --> 00:44:23,890
You really don't understand people, do you?

641
00:44:25,070 --> 00:44:29,350
I'm the kind of person who hates getting things without working for them.

642
00:44:31,130 --> 00:44:32,490
Look at that samurai Chan-chan.

643
00:44:32,550 --> 00:44:33,590
Have you seen the movie or not?

644
00:44:34,410 --> 00:44:39,130
He carried a knife in his heart for over 10 years to get revenge.

645
00:44:41,630 --> 00:44:42,970
That guy.

646
00:44:43,350 --> 00:44:46,210
If he gets taken down by someone else right in front of my eyes, how would I feel?

647
00:44:47,090 --> 00:44:48,250
Then what should we do?

648
00:44:50,050 --> 00:44:51,870
Whatever happens.

649
00:44:52,530 --> 00:44:55,690
You have to find that guy before the police do.

650
00:44:55,930 --> 00:44:56,690
Got it?

651
00:45:14,830 --> 00:45:15,830
Sir.

652
00:45:27,060 --> 00:45:28,600
Don't look, don't look.

653
00:45:29,320 --> 00:45:30,380
Don't look.

654
00:45:33,950 --> 00:45:35,470
Are you really sure?

655
00:45:35,970 --> 00:45:36,890
There's no doubt about it.

656
00:45:37,670 --> 00:45:39,610
I'm telling you, a cop is definitely following us.

657
00:45:40,950 --> 00:45:41,530
Hey.

658
00:45:42,370 --> 00:45:44,390
Don't cops have anything better to do?

659
00:45:44,610 --> 00:45:46,110
Following around good citizens like us.

660
00:45:47,090 --> 00:45:49,150
Where the hell is that Chunsam hiding?

661
00:46:02,060 --> 00:46:04,100
What's so great that they're making such a fuss?

662
00:46:04,740 --> 00:46:05,860
That's just how it is.

663
00:46:06,700 --> 00:46:08,880
Does the outside world cry and laugh according to your mood?

664
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:13,180
They don't have to, but that's what friends do.

665
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:14,780
Du-han.

666
00:46:15,100 --> 00:46:17,140
Don't act so righteous all by yourself.

667
00:46:17,360 --> 00:46:18,740
I'm sad about Chunsam too.

668
00:46:19,740 --> 00:46:20,260
Sigh.

669
00:46:20,440 --> 00:46:22,560
Since when have you ever worried about us?

670
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:23,220
Hey.

671
00:46:23,960 --> 00:46:25,180
You're talking about the past, right?

672
00:46:25,460 --> 00:46:26,700
Back when you were kids.

673
00:46:26,780 --> 00:46:30,720
That Pungmidang chrysanthemum bread I used to buy you every day during those hard times.

674
00:46:30,980 --> 00:46:32,540
Don't you remember eating that for several meals?

675
00:46:32,980 --> 00:46:34,660
I want to throw up all that chrysanthemum bread.

676
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:36,300
Hey, you really.

677
00:46:36,500 --> 00:46:36,800
Sir, sir.

678
00:46:39,160 --> 00:46:39,680
Sir.

679
00:46:39,740 --> 00:46:39,740
Sir.

680
00:46:39,840 --> 00:46:39,840
Sir.

681
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:40,100
Sir.

682
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:40,240
Sir.

683
00:46:40,340 --> 00:46:40,340
Sir.

684
00:46:40,340 --> 00:46:40,340
Sir.

685
00:46:40,460 --> 00:46:40,720
Ah, why.

686
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:40,840
Why.

687
00:46:40,940 --> 00:46:40,940
Why.

688
00:46:41,560 --> 00:46:42,520
You just got here, why?

689
00:47:03,690 --> 00:47:05,690
Give me an answer before you start drinking.

690
00:47:06,170 --> 00:47:08,650
No one is coming in here.

691
00:47:08,870 --> 00:47:08,990
Yes.

692
00:47:09,570 --> 00:47:09,570
Yes.

693
00:47:09,690 --> 00:47:09,770
Yes.

694
00:47:09,770 --> 00:47:10,050
Go upstairs.

695
00:47:10,450 --> 00:47:11,050
Here.

696
00:47:12,010 --> 00:47:12,610
Here.

697
00:47:16,080 --> 00:47:16,460
Here?

698
00:47:20,980 --> 00:47:21,580
Hyeongdo.

699
00:47:22,040 --> 00:47:22,460
Hyeongdo.

700
00:47:24,700 --> 00:47:25,300
Chunsam.

701
00:47:26,300 --> 00:47:26,540
Wow.

702
00:47:26,840 --> 00:47:29,460
Isn't something happening at Yeomcheon Bridge because of me?

703
00:47:29,900 --> 00:47:30,160
What?

704
00:47:30,320 --> 00:47:30,920
Why are you here?

705
00:47:30,920 --> 00:47:32,120
That...

706
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:33,960
Yeomcheon Bridge is already...

707
00:47:34,380 --> 00:47:37,300
a mess, and two beggars have been arrested by the police.

708
00:47:37,580 --> 00:47:38,260
Who?

709
00:47:38,420 --> 00:47:38,540
Who?

710
00:47:38,700 --> 00:47:38,820
Who?

711
00:47:39,900 --> 00:47:40,900
Parrot and Fly.

712
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:41,560
Fly too?

713
00:47:42,700 --> 00:47:43,980
He's not even healthy.

714
00:47:44,460 --> 00:47:47,300
They're homeless, so who knows how they'll be treated.

715
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:48,860
They must be in a terrible state by now.

716
00:48:05,220 --> 00:48:05,940
Dokkae.

717
00:48:06,860 --> 00:48:07,280
Yes, sir.

718
00:48:08,140 --> 00:48:10,540
I smell a rotten stench coming from somewhere.

719
00:48:10,700 --> 00:48:10,880
How about it?

720
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:14,320
Hey.

721
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:15,060
He's my brother.

722
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:15,360
Wait a minute.

723
00:48:19,180 --> 00:48:19,860
Wow.

724
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:22,400
A runaway is living better than me.

725
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:24,880
Sitting pretty in a bathtub.

726
00:48:26,180 --> 00:48:26,480
Hey.

727
00:48:26,540 --> 00:48:26,940
Where are you going?

728
00:48:28,660 --> 00:48:29,340
Where?

729
00:48:29,900 --> 00:48:30,400
I have to go.

730
00:48:30,580 --> 00:48:32,060
My kids are about to be beaten to death because of me.

731
00:48:33,260 --> 00:48:35,100
They'll suffer a bit, but they won't die.

732
00:48:35,580 --> 00:48:37,060
Still, I can't just leave them to get beaten.

733
00:48:38,620 --> 00:48:41,240
Walking into the police station on your own two feet is insane.

734
00:48:41,240 --> 00:48:44,260
They're innocent, so they'll get beaten a little and then released.

735
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:49,680
But you'll be in prison until your hair turns white, or you'll become a target.

736
00:48:54,270 --> 00:48:56,150
Just hide here until tonight.

737
00:48:56,970 --> 00:48:58,910
And then leave for Incheon at dawn tomorrow.

738
00:48:59,430 --> 00:49:02,270
I'll find a boat that's smuggling people to Shanghai.

739
00:49:08,080 --> 00:49:09,180
Oh, that's right.

740
00:49:09,240 --> 00:49:09,540
Sir.

741
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,360
Anchovy is going to Shanghai.

742
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:18,720
I almost let him go, not knowing he was right under our noses.

743
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:21,240
Dokkae, you go to the police station now.

744
00:49:21,900 --> 00:49:22,460
Yes, sir.

745
00:49:23,560 --> 00:49:23,920
No.

746
00:49:24,380 --> 00:49:26,000
Just keep a close watch so they don't escape.

747
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:27,520
Yes, sir.

748
00:49:36,180 --> 00:49:36,800
Two.

749
00:49:45,320 --> 00:49:46,220
If you like it here, come in.

750
00:49:50,980 --> 00:49:52,240
Have you been keeping a good watch?

751
00:49:52,520 --> 00:49:52,940
Yes, sir.

752
00:49:53,360 --> 00:49:55,560
Du-han and the slippery one are gone, but that one hasn't moved an inch.

753
00:49:55,560 --> 00:49:55,740
Yes, sir.

754
00:49:55,960 --> 00:49:56,060
Sir.

755
00:49:56,120 --> 00:49:56,660
Did Du-han go?

756
00:49:57,020 --> 00:49:57,500
Yes, sir.

757
00:49:57,600 --> 00:49:57,900
Where?

758
00:49:58,980 --> 00:50:01,460
I'd appreciate it if you could give me a little time.

759
00:50:01,960 --> 00:50:09,260
Isn't it easier to catch a frog whose limbs are limp than one that's full of energy and jumping all over the place?

760
00:50:10,280 --> 00:50:10,820
And by the way.

761
00:50:11,360 --> 00:50:16,860
That guy and I go way back, so I have some things to sort out with him.

762
00:50:17,720 --> 00:50:19,800
It's fine to sort things out, but don't kill him.

763
00:50:20,340 --> 00:50:22,760
He still has a lot to confess.

764
00:50:23,140 --> 00:50:24,080
Don't you worry.

765
00:50:42,170 --> 00:50:43,030
Yes, sir.

766
00:50:43,030 --> 00:50:49,610
Either I die, or that guy dies, or we both die.

767
00:50:50,430 --> 00:50:53,770
You guys stay here and guard this place tight.

768
00:50:54,170 --> 00:50:58,850
And no matter what you hear, don't come in.

769
00:50:59,570 --> 00:51:00,010
Got it?

770
00:51:00,890 --> 00:51:01,270
Yes, sir.

771
00:51:24,660 --> 00:51:30,700
Tell them that Kim Chunsam, the Boss of Yeomcheon Bridge, got arrested for punching a Japanese guy.

772
00:51:32,140 --> 00:51:35,360
But that's not enough, so he's inciting the beggars!

773
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:41,840
I want to live my life meeting Chunsam whenever I miss him, and holding his hand whenever I want to.

774
00:51:42,620 --> 00:51:44,180
That guy is going to prison.

775
00:51:45,420 --> 00:51:47,460
I'll do whatever you want.

776
00:51:48,050 --> 00:51:49,160
Are you from Yeomcheon Bridge?

777
00:51:50,740 --> 00:51:51,740
Not Chunsam.

778
00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:55,580
You have to endure it.

779
00:51:56,553 --> 00:51:59,593
A Joseon beggar lives by his guts and dies by his guts

780
00:51:59,641 --> 00:52:03,281
