1
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:30,060
Anchovy, have you been well?

2
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:37,720
You'll know who I am just by hearing my voice.

3
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:43,900
In just a few days, a day more important than the one I lost my energy will come...

4
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:47,040
That day is the day I lost my eye.

5
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:51,060
Once a year...

6
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:54,920
I chew on a pollack head...

7
00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:04,390
The closer that day gets, the more I think of you...

8
00:01:26,757 --> 00:01:28,230
Didn't I tell you?

9
00:01:28,510 --> 00:01:30,830
Maybe he's happy because he knocked down Anchovy.

10

Precise Translation & Timing

11
00:01:56,510 --> 00:01:57,830
Stop, stop, stop!

12
00:01:59,190 --> 00:01:59,570
Are you okay?

13
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:00,950
Take it easy, you wild boar.

14
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:09,360
You be careful on your way in.

15
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:10,520
Thanks.

16
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:00,160
It's a robber!

17
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,080
Don't you know me?

18
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:10,680
I'm a beggar, you punk.

19
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,800
What kind of robber robs a beggar?

20
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:51,020
Huh?

21
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:52,540
It's Fly!

22
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:53,300
Fly!

23
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:54,100
Fly!

24
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:03,620
Your tiny face has gotten even smaller.

25
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:04,340
Are you okay?

26
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,100
Sit here, sit here.

27
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,660
Do your teeth hurt?

28
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:10,260
He put a hole in my tooth.

29
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:13,860
Hey, you must have gotten beaten up really bad.

30
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:15,440
How did your face get like this?

31
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:17,300
Hey, are you okay?

32
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:18,620
Of course I'm okay, man.

33
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:19,880
Get some water.

34
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,560
Hey, Barefoot, get some water.

35
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:24,480
Hey, you idiot, what happened to you?

36
00:04:35,890 --> 00:04:37,390
Why, why, why, why?

37
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:39,810
Where do you think you're going!

38
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:45,090
Where have you been, showing up now!

39
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:52,030
Bewitched by that vixen, you didn't even know your shack family was being beaten to a pulp, and now you're ignoring the guy who has your leg in a cast!

40
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:53,950
My teeth are sensitive.

41
00:04:54,050 --> 00:04:54,950
They're vicious bastards.

42
00:04:55,910 --> 00:04:58,450
They said they'll take two people every day until the Boss is caught.

43
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:00,150
No, getting beaten is better.

44
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:05,270
That guy with the glasses, the teacher or whatever...

45
00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:06,930
My teeth are sensitive.

46
00:05:07,730 --> 00:05:08,770
He said he's coming back tomorrow morning.

47
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:12,050
Boss, you need to lay low for a while.

48
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:16,410
If the Boss gets caught, all his teeth will be pulled out and he'll be killed.

49
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:24,890
Everyone, gather around.

50
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:37,640
I think I need to leave the shack for a while.

51
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:42,970
It won't be for long.

52
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:45,190
While I'm gone, Parrot.

53
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:49,860
Got it.

54
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:55,820
And absolutely no stealing or begging.

55
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:57,360
Fly, huh?

56
00:05:57,820 --> 00:05:58,680
I'll...

57
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:02,440
Okay.

58
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:04,600
And Raccoon.

59
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:08,260
Don't skip cleaning the market.

60
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:09,000
I'll keep an eye on it.

61
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:12,220
Hama.

62
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:15,100
It's been a while since you've collected from Hanilgwan, right?

63
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:19,220
I've been busy going back and forth between the gisaeng house and the hospital, but I'll take care of it.

64
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:26,470
And...

65
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:34,570
I'm sorry to you all.

66
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:42,860
It's already hard enough to get by, and I couldn't even take good care of you...

67
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,340
From tomorrow morning, there will be no more trouble in the shack.

68
00:06:51,890 --> 00:06:52,650
Boss!

69
00:06:57,140 --> 00:06:57,900
He's crazy.

70
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,260
Completely crazy.

71
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:04,020
Look at him running away to hide in that gisaeng's skirt even after being beaten like that.

72
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:06,860
The Boss is going to the police station on his own two feet.

73
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,420
Are you going to turn yourself in?

74
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:18,360
Are you going to the police station now?

75
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:20,460
Yeah.

76
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:22,740
It's going to be tough.

77
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,260
Think about it again.

78
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:25,680
There's nothing to think about.

79
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:26,620
The sooner I go, the better.

80
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:30,280
I met that woman at the gisaeng house.

81
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:33,480
She's waiting for the Boss.

82
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:37,760
Left Foot!

83
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:38,060
Huh?

84
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:40,900
You go to the Nambak shack and spread the word.

85
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:41,540
Yeah, got it.

86
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:43,080
Hama, you take Supyogyo.

87
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:44,060
Fly, you?

88
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,420
You're still sick, right?

89
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:46,080
No, hyung.

90
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:46,620
I'm fine.

91
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:48,220
I'll run to Cheonggyecheon.

92
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:48,960
Okay.

93
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:49,720
Raccoon, you?

94
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:49,960
Yeah.

95
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:50,540
Yeongcheon.

96
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:51,120
Seodaemun.

97
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:53,780
I'll take Mapo.

98
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:55,480
Spread the word well.

99
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:56,080
Yes.

100
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:03,440
Tell them that Kim Chunsam, the Boss of Yeomcheon Bridge, got arrested for punching a Japanese guy.

101
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:06,000
Got it?

102
00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:13,270
Let me offer you a drink.

103
00:08:16,130 --> 00:08:17,850
Drink up.

104
00:08:36,790 --> 00:08:37,810
Are you from Yeomcheon Bridge?

105
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:39,810
The Boss is waiting for you.

106
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:40,650
Where?

107
00:08:40,650 --> 00:08:42,410
He said to call the Cloud Moon.

108
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:43,430
The Cloud Moon?

109
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:44,590
I understand.

110
00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:45,130
Thank you.

111
00:08:46,810 --> 00:08:47,610
Yeong-jae.

112
00:09:33,450 --> 00:09:34,630
I've missed you.

113
00:09:36,730 --> 00:09:38,070
I've missed you.

114
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:38,790
A lot.

115
00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:40,490
Are you hurt?

116
00:09:40,890 --> 00:09:41,630
Are you in a lot of pain?

117
00:09:44,770 --> 00:09:48,250
I got this in a hurry, so it's not much, but it should be enough to hide for a while.

118
00:09:49,070 --> 00:09:53,090
Use this to go outside the Namdong Gate and send a person for me.

119
00:09:53,170 --> 00:09:54,650
I'll come find you as soon as possible.

120
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:04,160
I'm sorry.

121
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:08,980
This all happened because of me, I'm so...

122
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:10,580
It's too dark in here.

123
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:11,340
Come here.

124
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:30,530
I want to see your face, eyes, nose, and mouth clearly, Yeon-ji.

125
00:10:31,010 --> 00:10:32,610
We can meet again in a fortnight.

126
00:10:32,850 --> 00:10:32,910
We.

127
00:10:33,290 --> 00:10:36,290
I can't go outside the Namdong Gate.

128
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:37,430
Pardon?

129
00:10:38,350 --> 00:10:38,930
Why?

130
00:10:39,490 --> 00:10:40,890
If I go, my family will get hurt.

131
00:10:41,010 --> 00:10:42,110
I can't run away by myself.

132
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:43,810
It's because you don't know that person.

133
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:45,950
He might even do something to you, Chunsam.

134
00:10:47,370 --> 00:10:49,710
At worst, I'll just have to rot in prison for a few months.

135
00:10:50,830 --> 00:10:52,170
A few months in prison?

136
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:54,650
I won't allow it.

137
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:09,200
Ordinary people can do whatever they want, but a Boss is different.

138
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:09,940
What's so different?

139
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:11,480
It's your life, you can do whatever you want.

140
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:22,140
There's a new scholar in our shack, and he told me about freedom and love.

141
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:30,240
But until now, I've lived my life doing whatever I wanted, freely...

142
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:34,480
But... so that's changed.

143
00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:41,170
Do you regret it?

144
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:42,010
No.

145
00:11:42,810 --> 00:11:43,270
No.

146
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:48,470
It's just that I feel like the way I live has changed a bit...

147
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:50,550
How?

148
00:11:53,550 --> 00:11:58,270
Until now, I've only lived under the Yeomcheon Bridge, where the sun never shines...

149
00:12:00,110 --> 00:12:04,350
But now, the sun shines day and night.

150
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:11,880
A very bright sunlight.

151
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:25,980
I want to live my life seeing you whenever I miss you, and holding your hand whenever I want to.

152
00:12:32,770 --> 00:12:33,910
Take care.

153
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:44,880
Can I see you again?

154
00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:02,550
Hey, Kalchi!

155
00:14:02,970 --> 00:14:03,470
Long time no see.

156
00:14:03,850 --> 00:14:04,530
Did you hear the news?

157
00:14:04,770 --> 00:14:04,990
Yeah.

158
00:14:05,190 --> 00:14:06,490
Where's a guy like Chunsam-hyung?

159
00:14:06,710 --> 00:14:07,470
Those bastards.

160
00:14:07,470 --> 00:14:08,890
Did something happen?

161
00:14:09,130 --> 00:14:09,310
Let's go.

162
00:14:09,830 --> 00:14:09,930
Pardon?

163
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:16,090
Hey, Do-ah, hurry up and come out, man!

164
00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:42,230
Hey, what's going on?

165
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:52,240
Hey, did you see that seat?

166
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:41,780
Manager Abe!

167
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:43,540
Look at that!

168
00:16:19,340 --> 00:17:01,080
Let's get this party started! The beggar who came last year is back again! The dumba is spinning well. The penny I got this morning, I'll offer it to my master.

169
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:12,760
The spoiled rice I got this evening, I'll offer it to my master's dog.

170
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:46,940
The pumba is dancing well, hey, the pumba is dancing well. Our master who is like Confucius, our master who is like an apricot blossom, our beautiful master. Master, master, forsythia. Master, master, forsythia.

171
00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:21,990
What's this?

172
00:18:23,370 --> 00:18:23,870
Let go!

173
00:18:24,910 --> 00:18:25,410
Let go!

174
00:18:26,410 --> 00:18:26,990
Hey!

175
00:18:28,730 --> 00:18:29,630
Disperse them quickly!

176
00:18:34,130 --> 00:18:35,390
Disperse them quickly!

177
00:18:42,810 --> 00:18:43,850
Military police!

178
00:18:43,850 --> 00:18:44,890
It's the military police!

179
00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:45,650
Military police!

180
00:18:47,410 --> 00:18:47,930
Military police!

181
00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:49,210
Get the military police, quickly!

182
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:01,000
What happened to the military police?

183
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:02,600
Don't get caught!

184
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:05,180
Cheon-ssaem,

185
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:47,620
What about Cheon-ssaem?

186
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:49,080
He's at the police station.

187
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:53,640
Let's go inside and talk.

188
00:19:54,340 --> 00:20:00,400
A guy like you...

189
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:39,500
I can't believe a beggar would dare to assault an imperial officer of the Great Japanese Empire.

190
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:44,760
And yet, that's not enough, so he's inciting the beggars!

191
00:22:58,580 --> 00:22:59,620
Cheon-ssaem!

192
00:25:17,450 --> 00:25:18,490
Do you like poetry?

193
00:25:20,130 --> 00:25:20,390
Yes.

194
00:25:21,030 --> 00:25:22,690
Oh, so you like poetry too, Cheon-ssaem.

195
00:25:23,370 --> 00:25:24,810
Do you like crows, Yeon-ji?

196
00:25:24,810 --> 00:25:26,030
No.

197
00:25:26,430 --> 00:25:30,070
I think a nightingale or a cuckoo would be better.

198
00:25:30,830 --> 00:25:31,490
Pardon?

199
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:32,690
A cuckoo?

200
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:40,040
Because of money, I gave up what I wanted most in the world.

201
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:43,860
But what I need is money, not a man with a lot of money.

202
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,700
Can you say what you just said one more time?

203
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:48,940
No.

204
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:50,580
I don't remember what I said.

205
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:52,740
Can I come see you again?

206
00:26:58,570 --> 00:26:59,370
Yeah.

207
00:27:16,970 --> 00:27:18,710
I hope you get well soon.

208
00:27:20,710 --> 00:27:27,750
As I've always said, there's only one thing I want from you.

209
00:27:30,010 --> 00:27:36,930
They say a Joseon gisaeng is a flower that understands words, but it seems some flowers have no ears.

210
00:27:37,230 --> 00:27:39,330
Judging by how you don't understand my words.

211
00:27:39,490 --> 00:27:41,190
I don't listen to words that are not worth listening to.

212
00:27:42,650 --> 00:27:44,810
There are two kinds of women in the world.

213
00:27:46,190 --> 00:27:49,730
A woman who becomes more charming the more you see her, and a woman who becomes less appealing the more you see her.

214
00:27:50,810 --> 00:27:53,570
I think you're the second kind.

215
00:27:54,450 --> 00:27:54,850
Really?

216
00:27:56,010 --> 00:28:01,410
But the more I dislike a woman, the more I feel compelled to possess her.

217
00:28:01,750 --> 00:28:03,310
That guy is going to prison.

218
00:28:06,490 --> 00:28:09,210
You seem to have a special relationship with him.

219
00:28:09,210 --> 00:28:13,030
I've picked out a special place for him.

220
00:28:15,490 --> 00:28:17,630
The front lines of the South Sea Islands.

221
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:23,910
The war situation is bad, so it will be difficult for him to come back alive.

222
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:29,920
Oh no.

223
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:06,260
Just sleep.

224
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:10,280
When you've been beaten, sleeping is the best medicine.

225
00:30:45,890 --> 00:30:51,890
If the Boss dies, I'll die too.

226
00:30:57,780 --> 00:30:59,440
You can drink right now?

227
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:01,760
Of course, I'm so upset.

228
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:03,480
Is that the face of an upset person?

229
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:05,680
I'm going crazy because of that Chunsam guy.

230
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:07,620
That's why I'm drinking, so I don't go crazy.

231
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:09,080
This is no time to be drinking.

232
00:31:09,180 --> 00:31:11,080
Chunsam must be a ghost by now from all the beatings.

233
00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:13,740
Then will you take the beating for him?

234
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:17,160
A friend is someone who dies with you and gets beaten with you.

235
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:21,940
Instead of getting beaten together, it's a hundred times better to bring him some rice cakes.

236
00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:23,620
Meat is even better.

237
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:26,800
Don't worry about that Chunsam guy.

238
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:28,920
He'll never die.

239
00:31:29,980 --> 00:31:32,780
He's the guy who survived even after being caught by a tiger when he was a kid.

240
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:34,560
Oh, it's cold.

241
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:40,120
If you're going to treat someone like a person, you should treat them like a person.

242
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:47,760
This freezing cold air is seeping into my bones. How can a person survive without freezing to death?

243
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:57,180
Shouldn't you at least give us a heater or a hot water bottle?

244
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:58,680
Chunsam, shut up!

245
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:06,790
You have to give me a reason to shut up.

246
00:32:12,230 --> 00:32:14,350
If you give me a disease, you should also give me the cure.

247
00:32:16,110 --> 00:32:20,590
You beat the kid until he was completely broken.

248
00:32:21,490 --> 00:32:23,130
You don't even care about him like a dog.

249
00:32:23,510 --> 00:32:25,510
You just threw him a lump of rice and that's it.

250
00:32:25,870 --> 00:32:26,810
What kind of law is this?

251
00:32:27,570 --> 00:32:28,730
Oh, you bad people.

252
00:32:28,870 --> 00:32:29,950
Please stop.

253
00:32:30,070 --> 00:32:31,370
Don't get dragged in and get beaten up.

254
00:32:32,430 --> 00:32:33,950
Are you saying I have a big liver?

255
00:32:35,410 --> 00:32:41,190
Even if it's not a Japanese world, a person should be able to say what they want to say.

256
00:32:42,150 --> 00:32:44,630
Even if I have to go, I have to say what I have to say.

257
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:48,190
This will be your first and last visit.

258
00:32:48,730 --> 00:32:52,350
If you're taken to the South Seas in April, you won't be able to come back.

259
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:56,520
Does that person know too?

260
00:33:37,470 --> 00:33:38,390
What should I do?

261
00:33:41,490 --> 00:33:42,870
This is all because of me...

262
00:33:42,870 --> 00:33:43,790
I'm fine.

263
00:33:46,670 --> 00:33:51,210
I don't have to worry about starving to death, and as long as I have a strong will, I can endure it.

264
00:34:03,450 --> 00:34:05,370
You don't need to worry about me.

265
00:34:07,390 --> 00:34:12,130
I'll just eat the prison food and endure it for a few months, and then I'll be out.

266
00:34:15,430 --> 00:34:17,070
Don't come here again, Yeon-ji.

267
00:34:17,930 --> 00:34:19,690
I don't like you coming to a place like this.

268
00:34:20,070 --> 00:34:20,530
Why?

269
00:34:22,390 --> 00:34:24,530
I'm here to see you, Chunsam. Who cares what anyone says?

270
00:34:24,850 --> 00:34:25,930
Still, this place is...

271
00:34:25,930 --> 00:34:26,770
I don't care.

272
00:34:29,450 --> 00:34:31,310
I'll be out soon. Let's meet then.

273
00:34:35,230 --> 00:34:36,890
Can I see you again?

274
00:34:42,620 --> 00:34:48,420
When I get out, we can go eat hotteok together and go to the Swallow Cafe...

275
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:52,320
Coffee...

276
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:54,960
Yes, we can drink coffee.

277
00:34:58,530 --> 00:35:00,650
You don't have to read to me, Crow.

278
00:35:02,950 --> 00:35:07,230
Actually, I don't understand a single word of this.

279
00:35:07,390 --> 00:35:08,530
It's the same for everyone.

280
00:35:09,510 --> 00:35:11,150
They just pretend to know.

281
00:35:13,550 --> 00:35:22,070
Until I met you, Yeon-ji, I never once thought I needed to learn how to read. But since meeting you, I've become frustrated.

282
00:35:23,030 --> 00:35:25,570
When I get out, I'll send my kids to school.

283
00:35:26,090 --> 00:35:28,150
Even if they're beggars, they should live like human beings.

284
00:35:31,450 --> 00:35:37,830
I know you're a better person than anyone else, even if you have nothing and are uneducated.

285
00:35:39,030 --> 00:35:40,390
Especially to me.

286
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:47,160
You look even prettier when you smile, Yeon-ji.

287
00:35:56,750 --> 00:35:57,690
I...

288
00:35:57,690 --> 00:35:59,730
When I think of you, I can do anything.

289
00:36:00,730 --> 00:36:01,310
Pardon?

290
00:36:02,290 --> 00:36:04,050
First, don't get hurt.

291
00:36:05,470 --> 00:36:06,110
Go inside.

292
00:36:06,950 --> 00:36:07,830
You go first.

293
00:36:08,870 --> 00:36:10,290
I'll watch you go in.

294
00:36:10,830 --> 00:36:13,930
This is my house, and you're my guest, so you go first.

295
00:36:17,860 --> 00:36:19,840
Please don't get hurt.

296
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:27,300
If you're well, Yeon-ji, then I'm well too.

297
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:13,580
Come in.

298
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:37,580
Please let that person go.

299
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:41,840
It's too late.

300
00:37:42,940 --> 00:37:47,500
The roster has already been sent, so even the Governor-General can't do anything about it.

301
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:49,520
You can do it, Director.

302
00:37:51,460 --> 00:38:00,560
I'm grateful that you value my abilities more than the Governor-General, but you've come too late.

303
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:08,940
In a fortnight, you'll receive that man's ashes.

304
00:38:13,410 --> 00:38:14,450
Please.

305
00:38:17,410 --> 00:38:19,710
I'll do anything you want.

306
00:38:29,830 --> 00:38:30,910
Anything.

307
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:40,220
Just please release that person.

308
00:38:47,950 --> 00:38:52,330
And I'll see you tomorrow night at Huian-gak.

309
00:39:32,350 --> 00:39:36,990
Thank you for soothing my lonely heart all this time.

310
00:39:38,750 --> 00:39:45,310
Life is so futile, but thanks to you, I've lived a less futile life than others.

311
00:39:45,310 --> 00:39:48,250
Why are you being so dramatic, you idiot?

312
00:39:48,970 --> 00:39:54,470
From now on, you'll never meet a man as handsome as me again, not even in your dreams.

313
00:39:54,490 --> 00:39:55,130
Where are you going?

314
00:39:59,250 --> 00:40:00,750
I'm going to die now.

315
00:40:02,950 --> 00:40:04,510
Is that a letter you write when you're about to die?

316
00:40:04,830 --> 00:40:06,290
What's a letter you write when you're about to die?

317
00:40:07,030 --> 00:40:07,850
A suicide note.

318
00:40:08,750 --> 00:40:10,010
Are you going to die after writing a suicide note?

319
00:40:10,630 --> 00:40:11,390
That's not it.

320
00:40:12,690 --> 00:40:15,250
I received a notice that I'm being drafted to Sakhalin.

321
00:40:17,110 --> 00:40:18,710
Do beggars get those too?

322
00:40:19,190 --> 00:40:22,010
I'm on a different level from other beggars who don't even know their last name.

323
00:40:22,850 --> 00:40:27,930
I have parents, a name, and everything is on the national registry. If I don't go, my father will go instead.

324
00:40:28,990 --> 00:40:30,970
Didn't he say he doesn't even treat you like a son?

325
00:40:31,270 --> 00:40:32,550
Still, he's my father.

326
00:40:46,670 --> 00:40:47,390
Yeong-seon.

327
00:40:48,590 --> 00:40:50,630
What are you doing, calling me by my real name?

328
00:40:50,630 --> 00:40:56,350
We're parting ways with passionate love, what kind of mood would it be if I called you Crow?

329
00:40:58,510 --> 00:41:00,050
You try calling me that too.

330
00:41:02,370 --> 00:41:03,330
Hama.

331
00:41:04,070 --> 00:41:05,630
Not Hama, call me Mr. Hong-pal.

332
00:41:09,470 --> 00:41:12,090
Mr. Hong-pal, take care.

333
00:41:13,570 --> 00:41:13,790
Yeah.

334
00:41:15,510 --> 00:41:17,430
Take care of your one and only life.

335
00:41:18,650 --> 00:41:18,950
Yeah.

336
00:41:21,490 --> 00:41:22,630
Hey, Hama!

337
00:41:24,490 --> 00:41:25,510
You clueless fool.

338
00:41:25,950 --> 00:41:27,390
Read this.

339
00:41:28,070 --> 00:41:32,250
I went to Gyeongseong Bukcheong Restaurant, and instead of giving me the fodder I asked for, they just gave me this useless piece of paper.

340
00:41:32,590 --> 00:41:34,130
So you didn't bring anything?

341
00:41:34,290 --> 00:41:35,050
So the kids have to starve again?

342
00:41:37,150 --> 00:41:38,570
You got the same thing?

343
00:41:41,930 --> 00:41:42,890
Who's Park Man-su?

344
00:41:43,710 --> 00:41:44,510
There's no such person here.

345
00:41:45,130 --> 00:41:46,610
That's my real name.

346
00:41:47,530 --> 00:41:48,390
You have a name?

347
00:41:48,590 --> 00:41:50,050
Yes, my grandfather gave it to me when I was young...

348
00:41:50,050 --> 00:41:51,010
You arrogant fool.

349
00:41:51,810 --> 00:41:57,770
No, but Hama and Myeongtae, that's one thing, but we don't have a clan. How did we get a draft notice?

350
00:41:57,970 --> 00:41:58,810
You must have a clan.

351
00:41:59,030 --> 00:42:00,290
Your address and name are all on it.

352
00:42:00,630 --> 00:42:01,850
We don't have names.

353
00:42:02,350 --> 00:42:03,750
He must be confused because it's in Chinese characters.

354
00:42:03,910 --> 00:42:04,590
Gimbap, you read it.

355
00:42:08,990 --> 00:42:09,300
Kim Aeng-mu...

356
00:42:11,050 --> 00:42:11,670
Yeo-gu-ri?

357
00:42:12,830 --> 00:42:13,350
Yeo-gu-ri?

358
00:42:15,070 --> 00:42:15,630
Raccoon?

359
00:42:17,290 --> 00:42:17,910
Aeng-mu?

360
00:42:19,150 --> 00:42:19,770
Parrot?

361
00:42:20,570 --> 00:42:21,510
Is that my name?

362
00:42:22,010 --> 00:42:22,530
What about me?

363
00:42:25,410 --> 00:42:25,930
Lee Mam-bal.

364
00:42:26,250 --> 00:42:27,790
Why am I Mam-bal?

365
00:42:28,050 --> 00:42:28,970
I'm Barefoot.

366
00:42:29,090 --> 00:42:29,830
Hey, you ignorant fool.

367
00:42:29,850 --> 00:42:30,850
It's because it's written in Chinese characters.

368
00:42:31,070 --> 00:42:31,370
Ah, wait a minute.

369
00:42:31,570 --> 00:42:32,090
Don't I have a name?

370
00:42:32,290 --> 00:42:33,830
Girls are not applicable.

371
00:42:35,270 --> 00:42:36,310
Then what about the address?

372
00:42:38,970 --> 00:42:40,010
Yeomcheon Bridge, Gyeongseong...

373
00:42:40,010 --> 00:42:40,330
Ah, wait a minute.

374
00:42:40,830 --> 00:42:41,590
See if the Boss is there.

375
00:42:41,650 --> 00:42:41,850
Hurry.

376
00:42:44,670 --> 00:42:45,190
He's not here.

377
00:42:47,630 --> 00:42:51,090
Since they've gathered them all together and put them in one address.

378
00:42:52,070 --> 00:42:53,230
They'll be dragged away without a choice.

379
00:42:53,430 --> 00:42:55,210
I guess I don't have to worry about my hair anymore.

380
00:42:57,370 --> 00:43:02,030
If all the beggars from Yeomcheon Bridge and Yeongcheon gather, there'll be about 60 or 70 of them.

381
00:43:02,530 --> 00:43:04,650
This is a really good thing.

382
00:43:05,170 --> 00:43:06,710
It's not that great of a thing.

383
00:43:10,110 --> 00:43:14,650
Sending dirty beggars to the National Defense Corps is a disgrace to the empire.

384
00:43:14,650 --> 00:43:17,230
It may be a disgrace to the empire, but...

385
00:43:17,790 --> 00:43:20,550
For those beggar punks, it's an honor they couldn't even dream of.

386
00:43:20,890 --> 00:43:21,870
Of course.

387
00:43:23,510 --> 00:43:27,730
Those who would have starved to death can now die gloriously for the empire.

388
00:43:28,950 --> 00:43:29,770
In that case...

389
00:43:30,530 --> 00:43:34,890
Let's just load up that Anchovy punk and his cronies onto the draft train.

390
00:43:35,430 --> 00:43:38,350
You and I can stretch our legs and get some sleep.

391
00:43:38,870 --> 00:43:39,550
That's right.

392
00:43:39,550 --> 00:43:46,190
If the higher-ups find out we've dragged in even those without a clan, things could get noisy, so handle it quietly.

393
00:43:46,430 --> 00:43:48,410
Don't worry.

394
00:44:01,220 --> 00:44:01,700
Hey, man!

395
00:44:01,900 --> 00:44:03,240
What are you doing out there, you cowards!

396
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:04,120
Get in here, man!

397
00:44:04,300 --> 00:44:05,020
Stop messing around!

398
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:07,260
Get in there, man!

399
00:44:18,190 --> 00:44:22,650
Hey, man, I told you I'd take care of everything. Why are you crying like a little girl?

400
00:44:22,910 --> 00:44:24,330
It's because the Boss isn't here.

401
00:44:25,250 --> 00:44:27,930
The Boss would know what to do in a situation like this.

402
00:44:27,930 --> 00:44:29,110
What does he know?

403
00:44:29,750 --> 00:44:32,710
The Boss is in a tight spot himself right now.

404
00:44:33,630 --> 00:44:37,470
When the Boss isn't around, I'm the one who takes care of everything.

405
00:44:38,150 --> 00:44:39,170
What do you know?

406
00:44:39,790 --> 00:44:40,590
What are you going to do?

407
00:44:40,770 --> 00:44:41,410
Hey, are you going to go?

408
00:44:41,790 --> 00:44:43,410
I'm thinking, man.

409
00:44:44,690 --> 00:44:49,870
Still, we have to meet the Boss and get his permission to go to the draft.

410
00:44:50,070 --> 00:44:50,870
Hey, you ignorant fool.

411
00:44:51,330 --> 00:44:53,250
It's not like you won't go just because the Boss says not to.

412
00:44:54,170 --> 00:44:55,870
In times like this, our educated runaway...

413
00:44:55,870 --> 00:44:57,650
If the Boss says not to go, I won't go even if I die.

414
00:44:57,710 --> 00:44:59,570
Do you ask for the Boss's permission when you take a dump?

415
00:45:00,390 --> 00:45:02,910
What's the same about going to the draft and taking a dump?

416
00:45:03,090 --> 00:45:04,810
You have to do both even if you don't want to.

417
00:45:05,010 --> 00:45:05,550
What's the same?

418
00:45:05,590 --> 00:45:08,350
If you go to the draft, you die. If you don't go, you die. But if you take a dump, you're fine. If you don't, you're fine.

419
00:45:08,370 --> 00:45:10,310
You're saying it's fine if you take a dump or not?

420
00:45:10,610 --> 00:45:12,110
If you don't take a dump, you die.

421
00:45:12,550 --> 00:45:14,710
How do you live 365 days a year without taking a dump?

422
00:45:14,730 --> 00:45:16,210
I can, I can.

423
00:45:16,790 --> 00:45:18,510
Do you know you'll die if you don't take a dump?

424
00:45:18,950 --> 00:45:19,670
I can.

425
00:45:19,990 --> 00:45:20,330
Shut up.

426
00:45:20,890 --> 00:45:22,530
If you hold it in, you'll be in big trouble.

427
00:45:23,010 --> 00:45:23,530
Shut up.

428
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:30,060
Stop talking about shit.

429
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:32,260
You said you'd take care of it.

430
00:45:33,380 --> 00:45:34,680
Tell me what you're going to do.

431
00:45:38,080 --> 00:45:39,000
This is what we'll do.

432
00:45:39,580 --> 00:45:41,120
Hurry up and tell me what you're going to do.

433
00:45:41,720 --> 00:45:43,220
Will you just shut up? I'm trying to tell you.

434
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,360
We all...

435
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:51,540
...run to Inwangsan.

436
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:54,360
Is that your plan?

437
00:45:54,460 --> 00:45:57,480
You've been thinking all day in this rainy shack, and all you came up with is running to Inwangsan?

438
00:45:58,240 --> 00:46:01,060
There's not a single hiding place with all these people around.

439
00:46:01,060 --> 00:46:02,800
There's no point in idiots putting their heads together.

440
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:05,020
Okay, okay.

441
00:46:05,140 --> 00:46:05,840
I have another idea.

442
00:46:06,120 --> 00:46:06,840
Hey, give that here.

443
00:46:16,790 --> 00:46:17,830
We all...

444
00:46:19,510 --> 00:46:20,550
...stay put.

445
00:46:22,630 --> 00:46:24,050
We're not going anywhere.

446
00:46:24,490 --> 00:46:25,950
What kind of freezing prison is this for a beggar?

447
00:46:26,210 --> 00:46:27,450
What if they come with guns and knives?

448
00:46:27,530 --> 00:46:28,570
We'll think about that when it happens.

449
00:46:28,790 --> 00:46:30,730
Yeah, you handle it well.

450
00:46:30,890 --> 00:46:31,290
Do it well.

451
00:46:31,290 --> 00:46:32,510
You're a birdbrain.

452
00:46:32,710 --> 00:46:34,130
If you ask the Boss, it'll be solved right away.

453
00:46:34,150 --> 00:46:35,630
Then why don't you tell me, man?

454
00:46:35,930 --> 00:46:37,250
Are you the only bird, Crow?

455
00:46:37,430 --> 00:46:38,410
Crows are birds too, man.

456
00:46:39,110 --> 00:46:40,390
Do you have any special talents?

457
00:46:40,610 --> 00:46:41,370
Tell me, tell me, man.

458
00:46:41,850 --> 00:46:44,690
I think it would be best to meet Kim Du-han and Lee Myung-do.

459
00:46:47,530 --> 00:46:52,210
They've probably faced a similar problem, so they might have found a solution.

460
00:46:56,750 --> 00:46:57,550
Yeah, that's it.

461
00:46:59,570 --> 00:47:00,670
That's exactly what I was thinking.

462
00:47:02,170 --> 00:47:04,570
The metal fly was caught hiding under the millstone.

463
00:47:05,230 --> 00:47:05,730
What about Hammer?

464
00:47:06,470 --> 00:47:10,890
Hammer was on his way to his hometown when he was captured by the military police.

465
00:47:12,070 --> 00:47:17,530
Half of the guys who got draft notices are in hiding, and it looks like the Japanese are trying to wipe out all the young men in Jongno.

466
00:47:20,170 --> 00:47:21,150
Order some red bean porridge.

467
00:47:22,250 --> 00:47:24,490
Boiling hot, enough to burn the roof of your mouth.

468
00:47:25,050 --> 00:47:26,390
Give me a bowl of hot red bean porridge.

469
00:47:27,630 --> 00:47:28,470
What do you mean, one bowl?

470
00:47:29,250 --> 00:47:29,930
Order by the pair.

471
00:47:29,930 --> 00:47:31,390
Bring me a cup.

472
00:47:31,830 --> 00:47:31,990
Yes.

473
00:47:32,630 --> 00:47:39,190
Sir, everyone's been dragged away and Jongno is empty. If those Japanese bastards push their way in...

474
00:47:39,190 --> 00:47:41,930
How much does it cost to bury someone these days?

475
00:47:42,430 --> 00:47:42,570
Pardon?

476
00:47:43,410 --> 00:47:44,730
About 100 won should do it.

477
00:47:45,830 --> 00:47:47,890
If we all empty our pockets, we should have that much.

478
00:47:48,370 --> 00:47:48,910
Who died?

479
00:47:50,370 --> 00:47:51,010
Me, you punk.

480
00:47:52,450 --> 00:47:54,070
I'm going to have a showdown with that Abe guy.

481
00:47:55,330 --> 00:47:58,070
If they keep taking our kids...

482
00:47:59,310 --> 00:48:01,370
I'll kill that bastard and then I'll die too.

483
00:48:05,190 --> 00:48:07,710
Du-han, we've got a big problem.

484
00:48:07,830 --> 00:48:09,590
The beggars are all going to be drafted.

485
00:48:10,570 --> 00:48:11,750
Sit down and eat some red bean porridge.

486
00:48:12,310 --> 00:48:13,490
Red bean porridge is good, but...

487
00:48:13,930 --> 00:48:15,730
The draft is a more urgent matter...

488
00:48:16,190 --> 00:48:16,950
I told you to eat.

489
00:48:17,270 --> 00:48:17,450
Yes.

490
00:48:19,490 --> 00:48:20,950
Just go.

491
00:48:21,250 --> 00:48:22,350
Is that a brothel?

492
00:48:22,750 --> 00:48:23,290
You just go?

493
00:48:23,290 --> 00:48:24,570
Why would I go?

494
00:48:24,670 --> 00:48:25,510
If you can avoid it, you should.

495
00:48:26,390 --> 00:48:27,610
Avoid what you can.

496
00:48:27,930 --> 00:48:27,930
Huh?

497
00:48:28,450 --> 00:48:29,730
Hey, can you stop the rain?

498
00:48:29,850 --> 00:48:30,810
Can you stop the lightning?

499
00:48:31,050 --> 00:48:32,370
There are things you can't control.

500
00:48:32,810 --> 00:48:33,890
If you go, you die.

501
00:48:34,790 --> 00:48:35,810
You won't die, man.

502
00:48:37,690 --> 00:48:39,910
Even if you go into a tiger's den, you'll survive if you keep your wits about you.

503
00:48:40,290 --> 00:48:42,690
This is several times worse than going into a tiger's den.

504
00:48:43,370 --> 00:48:45,510
Cannonballs are flying all over the place. How can you dodge them?

505
00:48:45,890 --> 00:48:48,370
If you can't dodge them, the cannonballs will.

506
00:48:49,530 --> 00:48:52,390
Why would they target a beggar when there are so many important people around?

507
00:48:54,270 --> 00:48:56,270
Don't talk so carelessly just because it's not your problem.

508
00:48:57,550 --> 00:49:01,430
Whether it's someone else's problem or mine, it's better to give up on things that are impossible early on.

509
00:49:01,550 --> 00:49:02,710
That's what's smart.

510
00:49:06,560 --> 00:49:07,840
Hey, Kim Du-han.

511
00:49:07,880 --> 00:49:10,400
I was going to meet you anyway, so it's good you came today.

512
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:11,580
Sit down, sit down.

513
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:13,480
Stop taking my kids.

514
00:49:16,180 --> 00:49:17,920
I'm a very ignorant man.

515
00:49:18,580 --> 00:49:21,340
If you keep acting like this, I won't just stand by.

516
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:26,160
The Sapa-ri that was captured the other day is the only son for three generations.

517
00:49:26,220 --> 00:49:27,140
How can this be?

518
00:49:28,180 --> 00:49:33,660
Even if you take them, they're useless troublemakers. Why are you so persistent...

519
00:49:35,740 --> 00:49:39,060
That's exactly why I wanted to meet you.

520
00:49:40,980 --> 00:49:44,320
I'm planning to create a special group for you and your men.

521
00:49:46,260 --> 00:49:47,020
What is it?

522
00:49:48,180 --> 00:49:49,060
The National Defense Guard.

523
00:49:50,060 --> 00:49:53,320
Everyone except those who have already been drafted will participate.

524
00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:56,860
What do they do there?

525
00:49:57,380 --> 00:49:59,260
In the current situation, there's no distinction between the front and rear lines.

526
00:50:00,380 --> 00:50:05,040
Even in the rear, you have to fight and serve just like on the front lines.

527
00:50:05,660 --> 00:50:08,420
I'm good at fighting, but I'm terrible at serving...

528
00:50:11,820 --> 00:50:16,620
If you don't want to serve, you can go get drafted and live or die as you please.

529
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:28,920
The National Defense Guard will be doing labor service at military factories and workshops near Gyeongseong.

530
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:37,180
While you're at it, can't you include the kids who are about to be drafted and the beggar kids?

531
00:50:39,120 --> 00:50:41,320
People who have already received their draft notices can't be included.

532
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:58,020
Since we've put similar guys in one place, it'll be easier to control the mood and prevent trouble.

533
00:50:58,580 --> 00:50:59,000
Of course.

534
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:03,520
If the situation worsens, they're the most likely to become a disloyal force, so we need to keep a close eye on them.

535
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:05,300
Yes, don't worry.

536
00:51:06,040 --> 00:51:07,120
We're at war right now.

537
00:51:08,360 --> 00:51:14,140
If a problem arises, we can just issue a mobilization order, drag them all to a mountain, and finish them off.

538
00:51:18,460 --> 00:51:20,340
Yes, hello... hello?

539
00:51:22,660 --> 00:51:23,600
Yes.

540
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:25,740
Yes.

541
00:51:25,740 --> 00:51:25,800
Yes.

542
00:51:28,300 --> 00:51:29,100
Ah, yes.

543
00:51:29,160 --> 00:51:29,560
I understand.

544
00:51:29,700 --> 00:51:30,800
I'm sorry to bother you.

545
00:51:31,640 --> 00:51:32,040
Yes.

546
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:33,900
But...

547
00:51:39,370 --> 00:51:40,150
Bring Chunsam.

548
00:51:42,610 --> 00:51:43,250
Yes.

549
00:51:44,090 --> 00:51:45,190
What did you come here to do?

550
00:51:51,830 --> 00:51:53,690
Look at this guy's face, covered in fists.

551
00:51:54,610 --> 00:51:55,610
You should have hit him with a bone.

552
00:51:57,370 --> 00:51:58,150
Where's your turf?

553
00:51:59,850 --> 00:52:00,070
Pardon?

554
00:52:01,230 --> 00:52:02,530
I said, where is your territory?

555
00:52:02,810 --> 00:52:03,510
Who are you under?

556
00:52:04,810 --> 00:52:06,810
I'm not under anyone, just on my own...

557
00:52:08,730 --> 00:52:08,830
Yes.

558
00:52:09,550 --> 00:52:10,470
Look at me carefully.

559
00:52:10,750 --> 00:52:11,330
Don't you know me?

560
00:52:13,910 --> 00:52:15,230
I don't think I do.

561
00:52:16,410 --> 00:52:17,090
You know Sucheol-ri, right?

562
00:52:18,270 --> 00:52:19,290
I'm Wang-ho of Sucheol-ri.

563
00:52:20,190 --> 00:52:21,370
I've never heard of you.

564
00:52:21,810 --> 00:52:23,570
Ah, this guy is completely...

565
00:52:25,430 --> 00:52:26,010
Hey.

566
00:52:28,690 --> 00:52:32,610
Double-Blade and Du-han of Jongno.

567
00:52:33,010 --> 00:52:34,470
Haryong of Myeongdong.

568
00:52:35,210 --> 00:52:37,770
Gulbi-ppyeo of Yeongdeungpo.

569
00:52:40,570 --> 00:52:43,390
And is there anywhere I don't know?

570
00:52:44,390 --> 00:52:45,190
Where did you say you're from?

571
00:52:45,310 --> 00:52:45,870
Where's your turf?

572
00:52:46,690 --> 00:52:47,730
I live in Yeomcheon Bridge.

573
00:52:48,190 --> 00:52:50,430
Yeomcheon... you're from Yeomcheon Bridge?

574
00:52:51,690 --> 00:52:53,270
Ah, this guy...

575
00:52:53,270 --> 00:52:54,510
Then you must know who's there.

576
00:52:55,890 --> 00:52:57,150
You must know Chunsam.

577
00:52:58,370 --> 00:52:59,130
Chunsam.

578
00:52:59,310 --> 00:53:02,270
That guy who dries cheeks has a lot of guts.

579
00:53:02,410 --> 00:53:03,070
It must have been huge there.

580
00:53:04,010 --> 00:53:05,210
I was very hungry.

581
00:53:05,690 --> 00:53:06,630
I raised him there.

582
00:53:07,470 --> 00:53:08,850
You've heard a lot about Chunsam, right?

583
00:53:09,470 --> 00:53:09,990
Chunsam.

584
00:53:10,270 --> 00:53:10,430
Yes.

585
00:53:11,950 --> 00:53:12,870
I'm Chunsam.

586
00:53:14,730 --> 00:53:16,090
What did I just say?

587
00:53:16,130 --> 00:53:17,530
I'm Kim Chunsam.

588
00:53:18,090 --> 00:53:18,210
What?

589
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:24,400
You're Chunsam?

590
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:25,320
Yes.

591
00:53:34,340 --> 00:53:35,240
Show me some proof.

592
00:53:38,600 --> 00:53:40,900
Hey, you have to let people sleep.

593
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:42,580
Do you beat people up in the middle of the night?

594
00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:43,400
Come out here.

595
00:53:44,500 --> 00:53:45,860
Ah, I really...

596
00:53:45,860 --> 00:53:46,880
Not that, it's Kim Chunsam.

597
00:54:01,940 --> 00:54:03,220
Hey, Chunsam.

598
00:54:03,860 --> 00:54:04,680
You have to endure it.

599
00:54:06,080 --> 00:54:08,820
A Joseon beggar lives by his guts and dies by his guts.

600
00:54:08,820 --> 00:54:11,280
You have to endure it even if it hurts.

601
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:14,200
What do I do? The second day hurts the most.

602
00:54:14,780 --> 00:54:15,120
Endure it.

603
00:54:15,340 --> 00:54:16,260
Grit your teeth and endure it.

604
00:54:25,820 --> 00:54:26,420
I...

605
00:54:53,710 --> 00:54:56,530
I can't do anything because he's a person I really like.

606
00:54:57,230 --> 00:54:59,050
Let's go together, Chunsam.

607
00:54:59,150 --> 00:54:59,470
Please.

608
00:54:59,769 --> 00:54:59,983
Huh?

609
00:55:00,490 --> 00:55:01,970
Please save our kids!

610
00:55:02,090 --> 00:55:03,350
What's going to happen to me?

611
00:55:03,650 --> 00:55:04,710
Should I just get my eye gouged out?

612
00:55:04,730 --> 00:55:05,650
Why are you like this, you bastard!

613
00:55:06,110 --> 00:55:07,590
Hey, you know a thing or two.

614
00:55:07,950 --> 00:55:09,010
Do you know my father?

615
00:55:09,390 --> 00:55:11,650
If you don't know the general in Joseon, are you even a Joseon person?

616
00:55:11,650 --> 00:55:13,290
That guy must be sent to prison.

617
00:55:24,087 --> 00:55:32,500
