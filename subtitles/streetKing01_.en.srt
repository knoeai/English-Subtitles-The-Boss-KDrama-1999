00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:20,670
Having fun?

3
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:23,090
Newspapers aren't for “fun.”

4
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:24,710
Not fun, right?

5
00:00:24,770 --> 00:00:26,620
If it's not fun, why would I read it?

6
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:27,270
What's this?

7
00:00:27,430 --> 00:00:28,710
So is it fun or not?

8
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:31,330
C'mon, hand it over!

9
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:32,090
I gotta take a dump!

10
00:00:32,510 --> 00:00:32,670
Hey!

11
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:32,970
Hey!

12
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:34,150
Hey!

13
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:49,500
This is a public second-round auction,
so if it's not settled by round two, it's over.

14
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:53,140
You sure about that story where you saved his life three times?

15
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:55,060
Or are you… what's the word…

16
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:56,140
…just blowing smoke?

17
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:57,330
Call it hot air, kid.

18
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:57,680
Huh?

19
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:02,600
Risking your life is hot air; him owing me is real. That's the point.

20
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:03,900
Don't worry.

21
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:05,240
What's wrong?

22
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:10,010
That watch… and those diamonds…

23
00:01:10,050 --> 00:01:13,130
Mr. Hong wants the gold bars and the diamonds, got it?

24
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:16,750
If the bid falls through, our Yeomcheon crew will be out on the street!

25
00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:17,290
You punk!

26
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:18,570
Quit freaking out!

27
00:01:19,210 --> 00:01:20,210
Don't worry.

28
00:01:21,130 --> 00:01:22,130
Boss!

29
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:25,050
The paper says Ms. Yeon-ji's shooting a film in Busan!

30
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:26,610
Read the room and sit still.

31
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:48,270
Well, look who it is—long time no see, chickens.

32
00:01:48,970 --> 00:01:50,050
Hey, Gyeong-do.

33
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:53,550
You're looking good these days, huh?

34
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:54,710
You look healthy, sir.

35
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:57,930
Still running around catching “Reds' kids” these days?

36
00:01:58,110 --> 00:01:59,610
Thanks to you, sir—doing fine.

37
00:01:59,690 --> 00:02:00,950
Nothing much going on.

38
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:02,070
Yes, long time.

39
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:03,730
I heard Chunsam headed up to Seoul?

40
00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:04,790
Yeah—yeah.

41
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:06,790
Should've blocked him at Seoul Station.

42
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:08,810
I sent our boys to Busan Station.

43
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:10,830
Who?

44
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:13,030
The nutcase Toe—he's the problem.

45
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:15,530
Toe?

46
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:19,050
Besides Double-Blade, who else went?

47
00:02:19,570 --> 00:02:22,120
Lee Jung-jae, Lee Hwa-ryong, Double-Blade—all went.

48
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:24,010
Du-han too?

49
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:25,110
Yes.

50
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:29,150
The Boss is getting a bit uppity.

51
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:33,410
Other thugs? Whatever, they're fine.

52
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:36,090
It's Toe who's the problem, I'm telling you.

53
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:37,930
Parrot.

54
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:44,790
Know why you'll never be a boss like Chunsam?

55
00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:48,250
Why poke the hornet's nest again?

56
00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:49,850
Say it, punk.

57
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:54,730
Well… I'm kind of short.

58
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:56,270
And?

59
00:02:57,550 --> 00:02:58,850
I'm not that smart either.

60
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:00,150
And?

61
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:05,150
I talk big… and can't really fight.

62
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:06,450
Good. One more.

63
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:08,310
What have you got?

64
00:03:08,570 --> 00:03:09,820
What's in your guts, huh?

65
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:12,570
You got no grit, kid.

66
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:14,580
You're crap for guts.

67
00:03:43,130 --> 00:03:43,650
Dokkae.

68
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:44,990
Yes, sir.

69
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:46,690
You lot search from the back.

70
00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:47,210
Yes.

71
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:47,970
Jeong-won.

72
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:48,490
Yes, sir.

73
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:51,510
You stand here and watch people closely.

74
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:52,030
Yes, got it.

75
00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:53,970
Everyone else, follow me.

76
00:03:54,350 --> 00:03:54,750
Clear?

77
00:03:54,990 --> 00:03:55,990
Yes.

78
00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:05,560
You guys, light one up.

79
00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:10,850
Boss, the train's coming in.

80
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:23,540
All right, boys—let's go.

81
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:25,340
Yes.

82
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:37,380
Big shoulders coming through the back.

83
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:39,820
Dokkae, Dokkae, Dokkae…

84
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:42,260
He looks like he's about to smash this fool.

85
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:44,320
Hey, you, Toe. Get out here.

86
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:50,340
See you later.

87
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:17,760
Follow only me—kill clean, okay?

88
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:58,530
Damn, that guy from Chunsam looks like he's been here a while.

89
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:02,330
Too bad, but you could take the last train up.

90
00:06:03,890 --> 00:06:04,890
You should watch.

91
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:05,990
Ah!

92
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:07,410
You little punk!

93
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:19,040
You bragged you'd take responsibility for Chunsam!

94
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,720
Leave it—leave it!

95
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,050
You get robbed and you're just going to shut your barn doors?

96
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:26,200
Forget it—move fast!

97
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:28,820
Scour Gusan and drag Kim Chunsam back here!

98
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:30,480
Let it go.

99
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:36,960
He lives on sheer guts. What's he gonna do at the auction house anyway?

100
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:40,760
I know you're tight with Chunsam, Du-han, but he can't live like that.

101
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:45,940
Feeding beggars is noble and all,
but respect other people's business too.

102
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:47,380
Gas—gas.

103
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:51,980
We fought like hell to shake
off those vultures sniffing money,

104
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,360
and now they want the payoff
without lifting a finger? Get real.

105
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:57,780
What are you doing, kid!

106
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:01,530
Search every flophouse
nearby, Yeong-go Inn, Yeongdo

107
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:05,400
Bridge—heck, the bottom of the sea
if you must. Find those beggar punks!

108
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:20,780
How'd it go?

109
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:23,720
The Boss's “connections” aren't working.

110
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:25,100
Really?

111
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:27,780
Parrot, come here.

112
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:31,960
Is this really the most famous hotel in Busan?

113
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:34,100
Yes, everyone says so.

114
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,170
Then you've got the best room, right?

115
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:37,840
Yes—the suite.

116
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:39,700
You're the manager here?

117
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:41,220
Yes, sir.

118
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,160
Don't you understand plain speech?

119
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,740
This guy's weird.

120
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:49,220
A VIP is coming down from Seoul and...

121
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:49,980
This way, please.

122
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:51,100
Welcome.

123
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:57,570
How many rooms, Secretary Wang?

124
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:01,940
Uh, yes.

125
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:05,820
They say there's no reservation?

126
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,300
What did you just say, Secretary Wang?

127
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:17,660
He's the manager.

128
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,040
He says Seoul didn't...

129
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,140
What kind of work is this, Secretary Wang!

130
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:23,280
Call the governor—now!

131
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,420
Go on—call the governor.

132
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:29,460
What are you doing!

133
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:30,780
I said call the governor!

134
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:32,340
Governor? Hello?

135
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:33,910
Do it like this, idiot!

136
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:35,060
You punk.

137
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:35,660
Hello.

138
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:36,800
Where are you dialing!

139
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:37,860
Press it—now!

140
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,560
Oh, an operator?

141
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:42,240
Connect me to the governor's office.

142
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:44,440
I said the governor—hurry it up!

143
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:46,000
See?

144
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,200
Governor?

145
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:49,020
Hey, it's me—me, me.

146
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,100
Unbelievable.

147
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,910
The VIP's secretary from Seoul.

148
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:55,780
Is this how you treat us?

149
00:09:57,140 --> 00:09:59,820
Even if you couldn't greet us at the station,

150
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:02,270
you should've at least held a room.

151
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:04,140
Seriously.

152
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:05,700
Bro...

153
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:07,920
Bro's got some business right now.

154
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:10,680
Hey, how many kids you got at home?

155
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:14,170
I'm watching. Your staying at home is a testament to your capability.

156
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:15,820
I should find a new job.

157
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:17,940
Actually, there is one room.

158
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:18,860
A suite.

159
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:20,750
Sir, they've got one “suit” room.

160
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:20,980
What?

161
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:22,580
A "suit"?

162
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:26,760
What good is one "suit" between the young master and me, you idiot?

163
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,550
No, there's an identical room, too.

164
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:30,400
You'll see, kid.

165
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:31,760
You'll go far.

166
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:38,040
Hey—you're the boss now.

167
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:39,720
Thanks.

168
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:45,500
Hey, Go-se.

169
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:46,480
Hey, Go-se.

170
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:47,580
Yes?

171
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:52,940
Earlier—you were bullshitting, but…

172
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:54,760
You've got good hands, kid.

173
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:56,300
Your eyes were convincing.

174
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:58,220
Wasn't the whole thing staged?

175
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,600
Still—can we really trust this?

176
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:04,560
This guy'll die doubting everything till the end.

177
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:07,640
He's more solid than pouring water into a field—trust me.

178
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,340
But if it goes south...

179
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:11,260
We'll be dealing with his sister raising hell.

180
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:12,040
Aren't you worried?

181
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:13,900
Why did Mr. Hong's men come?

182
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:17,050
They came last night and are staying at this hotel.

183
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:19,440
Come morning, they'll squat by the auction hall.

184
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:20,480
Hey, hey.

185
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:23,900
Listen up.

186
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:30,800
I'm going straight to meet the customs guys,
then early tomorrow I'm heading right to the auction.

187
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:34,500
You all know your jobs, right?

188
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:36,140
Yes.

189
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,250
Ease up on the booze.

190
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,800
Boss Wang, one sec.

191
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:42,400
Hm?

192
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:42,740
What?

193
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:45,820
Who were you talking to downstairs on the phone?

194
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:48,340
Mr. Gyu-han.

195
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:52,100
Man's voice is like a songbird.

196
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:56,120
Hey—how'd it go?

197
00:11:57,620 --> 00:11:58,820
We searched everywhere.

198
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:00,840
Properly?

199
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:06,060
We unleashed a hundred boys—Jagalchi Market to Yongdusan Park. Nothing.

200
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:08,360
You think he went back up?

201
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:10,000
Not his style.

202
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:10,820
Hey, Toe.

203
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:12,840
Take everyone and guard the auction.

204
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,930
Don't let a single Yeomcheon rat through.

205
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:18,460
Come on—cheers.

206
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:40,180
While he watches…

207
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:50,000
All right—let's get started.

208
00:13:56,170 --> 00:13:59,110
I'll announce the winning bidders for each lot.

209
00:14:00,810 --> 00:14:02,930
Saccharin, 1,500 kg.

210
00:14:03,930 --> 00:14:06,230
Winner: Kim Chunsam.

211
00:14:06,270 --> 00:14:09,230
Diamonds, 50 kg.

212
00:14:10,090 --> 00:14:12,570
Winner: Kim Soon-sam.

213
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:15,030
Gold bars, 2,000 kg.

214
00:14:15,070 --> 00:14:16,630
Hey—Toe, what happened!

215
00:14:17,650 --> 00:14:19,810
Kim Chunsam, British-made...

216
00:14:29,650 --> 00:14:31,370
Toe, you bastard!

217
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:38,240
Hilarious.

218
00:14:58,170 --> 00:14:59,170
How'd it go?

219
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:07,220
We give this to Mr. Hong's guys and go deposit it at the bank, right?

220
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:07,560
Go.

221
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:09,100
Good work.

222
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:09,680
Hop in.

223
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:10,740
Stop there.

224
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:13,620
I've got somewhere to swing by real quick.

225
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:14,700
Can't it wait?

226
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:15,800
We've got bank work.

227
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:18,720
You're starting to sound like Parrot.

228
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:19,840
What?

229
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:21,580
You gonna stand there?

230
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:22,520
Fine—go and come back fast.

231
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:23,740
Okay.

232
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:30,370
I'm strapped for cash these days.

233
00:15:30,450 --> 00:15:32,090
Lend me some iron—just a bit.

234
00:15:33,210 --> 00:15:34,260
C'mon, just a little.

235
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:40,540
Tightwad.

236
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,120
Cut! Cut!

237
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:47,900
Here...

238
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:51,340
How did you do that?

239
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Did you rehearse it?

240
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:54,200
Yeah, we rehearsed.

241
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:58,660
Move—move.

242
00:15:58,840 --> 00:15:59,840
I'll go.

243
00:16:13,830 --> 00:16:14,830
Damn…

244
00:16:15,490 --> 00:16:18,450
Hey, President Im!

245
00:16:20,590 --> 00:16:21,130
Huh?

246
00:16:21,470 --> 00:16:22,490
Hey, who's this?

247
00:16:22,830 --> 00:16:24,210
Isn't that the beggar chief?

248
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:24,390
Huh?

249
00:16:24,690 --> 00:16:26,870
Hey, long time no see, President Im.

250
00:16:27,030 --> 00:16:27,590
Oh yeah?

251
00:16:27,850 --> 00:16:27,990
Huh?

252
00:16:28,030 --> 00:16:28,810
What brings you to Busan?

253
00:16:28,970 --> 00:16:29,670
Small world.

254
00:16:29,930 --> 00:16:31,410
Nothing—just some fresh air.

255
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:34,770
Doesn't look like “nothing”…

256
00:16:34,810 --> 00:16:36,160
I met Kim Du-han yesterday.

257
00:16:36,510 --> 00:16:39,130
Every hood in the market's gathered here.

258
00:16:39,410 --> 00:16:40,930
What is it—a big juicy score?

259
00:16:46,450 --> 00:16:49,070
You two haven't seen each other in a while, huh?

260
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:53,680
Uh…

261
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:55,540
We wrapped shooting yesterday…

262
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:56,580
After lunch…

263
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:59,380
There's still a lot to film.

264
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:03,560
But…

265
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,600
Maybe just a coffee…

266
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:07,560
Let's go.

267
00:17:10,580 --> 00:17:11,580
Two coffees, please.

268
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:13,320
Oh...

269
00:17:26,350 --> 00:17:27,350
You seem tense.

270
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:30,800
I try to make it look that way.

271
00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:34,690
Learned it on the job:

272
00:17:35,310 --> 00:17:37,310
How to look fine no matter how you feel.

273
00:17:39,470 --> 00:17:41,050
You don't like film work?

274
00:17:42,670 --> 00:17:44,050
I like the work.

275
00:17:56,160 --> 00:18:00,240
It's just… my fate isn't to do what I love by the side of who I love.

276
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:01,560
That rumor about Seung-hwan...

277
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,000
You know Im made that up.

278
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,010
Why do you keep avoiding me, Chunsam?

279
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:09,620
Avoiding you? I'm sitting right here.

280
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:12,360
When I heard you were hurt, I searched every hospital.

281
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:15,280
If only Im hadn't said you died, I would've found you.

282
00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:22,710
It was wartime…

283
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,080
I was really okay.

284
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:27,220
Okay how?

285
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:28,910
What's “okay” about that?

286
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:32,620
I cried all night for days—begging you to come back alive.

287
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:34,780
Prayed and begged for you to return.

288
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:37,640
And you never sent a word?

289
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:40,280
Why make me the bad one?

290
00:18:49,450 --> 00:18:51,690
Didn't even know you were in a Seoul hospital…

291
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:53,630
Daegu, Busan…

292
00:18:53,670 --> 00:18:56,650
I searched like a crazy woman.

293
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:02,240
If you'd called once when you came to Seoul…

294
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:18,660
Do you remember?

295
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:19,760
I don't know.

296
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:47,320
Bitter but tasty broth…

297
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,200
Swallow Café…

298
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:00,660
I haven't changed at all.

299
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:06,800
You've changed a lot.

300
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:09,920
Wearing a nice suit and all…

301
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:13,560
Huh?

302
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:14,500
Hey, Left Foot!

303
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:15,710
No way—that can't be.

304
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:17,480
Uncle Wang-ho said he won the bid.

305
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:18,160
Right?

306
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:19,280
Hey, let me talk to him.

307
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:19,380
Sure.

308
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:20,600
What's going on?

309
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:21,790
Let me talk, just once.

310
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,320
Hold on—I'll switch you to the Boss.

311
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:24,640
Yes, this is the Boss's sister.

312
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:25,680
Sister?

313
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:29,800
Hello, Crow.

314
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:31,880
What?

315
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:33,520
They won't take the deposit!

316
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:36,960
Our guys took it to the bank in Busan—they refused it.

317
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:38,450
What the hell is happening?

318
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:43,100
Tell them to hold off tearing down the shack—people came.

319
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:44,520
And…

320
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:47,100
They've been yelling about demolishing it for an hour.

321
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:48,360
Okay, okay…

322
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:53,260
I'll handle things here. You send everyone back for now, got it?

323
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:54,140
Get the kids inside.

324
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:55,380
Right.

325
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:56,060
What's going on?

326
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:58,340
Crow—no, looks like Toe bribed the bank.

327
00:20:58,760 --> 00:20:59,920
It's Lee Jung-jae—Lee Jung-jae.

328
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:00,580
Where's the Boss?

329
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:02,120
He woke up in the car...

330
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:04,380
Said he'd do Busan business and ride back tomorrow.

331
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:06,120
I'm telling you—it's Lee Jung-jae.

332
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:09,710
They took the money—how does the bank refuse the deposit?

333
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:15,520
Hey!

334
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,240
Hey—Mr. Hong's men...

335
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:40,040
Where are the ones who went to Busan?

336
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:41,980
They're staying at this hotel with us.

337
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:45,740
They wanted to give up and go back to Seoul—I begged them to wait…

338
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:46,980
So why's Seoul in chaos?

339
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:47,960
How would I know?

340
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
I'm no mind reader!

341
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:50,170
I said I begged them!

342
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:52,480
Then why the fuss about tearing down the shack?

343
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:53,000
Tell them to wait!

344
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,800
Hey, I came down to Busan...

345
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:56,800
And what did you even do—why glare at me?

346
00:21:56,840 --> 00:22:00,380
That's not it—Toe's blocking the deposit at the bank!

347
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:01,740
It's Lee Jung-jae!

348
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:05,560
Toe's errand boy is working for Lee Jung-jae, right?

349
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:06,600
Enough!

350
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:09,040
It's Lee Jung-jae.

351
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:11,330
What do we do about the Boss?

352
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:14,060
If Mr. Hong's cash doesn't hit the bank, we'll all be kicked out.

353
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:18,700
Boss, maybe we're just not meant to live with roofs and windbreak walls.

354
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:19,860
That's our home.

355
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:23,570
It's the only place we can keep out the rain.

356
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:28,980
Parrot, when's the deposit deadline?

357
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:30,940
Tomorrow evening.

358
00:22:37,650 --> 00:22:39,390
Barefoot, bring my clothes.

359
00:22:40,030 --> 00:22:41,030
Why?

360
00:22:41,370 --> 00:22:42,870
I'll go settle this myself.

361
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:45,230
Raccoon, call Mr. Hong.

362
00:22:45,550 --> 00:22:49,100
Tell him we'll bring up the gold bars and diamonds by tomorrow evening.

363
00:22:49,850 --> 00:22:51,250
Hello?

364
00:22:52,130 --> 00:22:53,130
Yes?

365
00:22:54,910 --> 00:22:56,890
It's the Boss on the line.

366
00:22:59,890 --> 00:23:01,510
Hello, it's Kim Chunsam.

367
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:06,550
Toe.

368
00:23:07,610 --> 00:23:10,090
Well, nice to hear from you.

369
00:23:12,170 --> 00:23:14,610
No need to get so worked up.

370
00:23:16,250 --> 00:23:23,470
Next time you've got some of that
tasty “coffee broth,” share with me, yeah?

371
00:23:30,410 --> 00:23:32,570
Man, you're a quick one.

372
00:23:33,570 --> 00:23:35,330
How'd you figure it out so fast?

373
00:23:38,390 --> 00:23:40,050
I'm taking good care of her.

374
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:57,320
If she even loses a single hair—fine, okay.

375
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,440
I'm coming.

376
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Where are you?

377
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:01,980
Right.

378
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:04,940
What?

379
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:06,880
A waiver of the winning bid?

380
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:16,360
“I hereby forfeit the items I won at auction, unconditionally.”

381
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:20,900
Stamp it “Kim Chunsam,” and it's done.

382
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:28,020
And you have to come alone.

383
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:34,480
Don't drag along your ragtag beggars—it looks bad.

384
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:36,960
You get me, right?

385
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:48,920
You classless punks!

386
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:54,360
How can you treat a national star—beloved by all—with no manners at all?

387
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:58,540
You think the cops won't have words about this?

388
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:01,900
Cops?

389
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:06,880
Cops on the Liberal Party's leash—how do you think they'll “help”?

390
00:25:13,510 --> 00:25:18,150
Boss, what's Toe saying?

391
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:15,480
Hama.

392
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:16,820
Yes?

393
00:26:19,910 --> 00:26:22,190
Go get paper and something to write with.

394
00:26:26,070 --> 00:26:29,730
Toe says he'll make Kim Chunsam sign a forfeiture.

395
00:26:30,150 --> 00:26:31,150
How?

396
00:26:31,530 --> 00:26:34,190
He's not the type to give up easily.

397
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:37,170
They're baiting him with an old flame—an actress.

398
00:26:37,450 --> 00:26:37,690
Really?

399
00:26:38,470 --> 00:26:42,290
Then he's trapped—no way he can resist.

400
00:26:42,590 --> 00:26:44,550
What kind of business is this?

401
00:26:45,050 --> 00:26:47,070
Why are you so worked up?

402
00:26:47,310 --> 00:26:49,950
Business is business—but kidnapping a woman?

403
00:26:51,290 --> 00:26:52,910
Tell them to release her—now.

404
00:26:53,570 --> 00:26:54,570
Hey, blowhard.

405
00:26:55,190 --> 00:27:00,010
He's not trying to hurt her—no need to lose it.

406
00:27:00,270 --> 00:27:01,270
I'm embarrassed.

407
00:27:01,330 --> 00:27:02,930
This isn't how a man should act.

408
00:27:03,510 --> 00:27:04,510
Du-han...

409
00:27:04,950 --> 00:27:06,070
Don't be so rigid.

410
00:27:07,370 --> 00:27:10,490
In business, you use tricks and twists sometimes.

411
00:27:11,670 --> 00:27:18,490
I grew up brawling before my skull hardened,
but I never stooped to kidnapping women.

412
00:27:40,970 --> 00:27:41,990
All right.

413
00:27:55,910 --> 00:27:58,730
Well, Chunsam—long time.

414
00:27:59,410 --> 00:28:04,750
Toe, the world's changed, but you're the same old guy.

415
00:28:06,130 --> 00:28:07,130
Let the woman go.

416
00:28:07,970 --> 00:28:09,590
Got the forfeiture?

417
00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:29,350
Busy man—thanks for coming.

418
00:28:29,550 --> 00:28:30,550
You can go.

419
00:28:44,630 --> 00:28:49,970
Chunsam, you came ready for anything—and you're just leaving?

420
00:28:52,790 --> 00:28:53,790
Go first.

421
00:28:54,390 --> 00:28:55,430
Get out fast.

422
00:28:56,090 --> 00:28:56,730
You go first.

423
00:28:56,930 --> 00:28:57,510
Just go.

424
00:28:57,550 --> 00:28:58,650
Don't fight them.

425
00:28:59,430 --> 00:28:59,430
Right?

426
00:28:59,690 --> 00:29:00,330
I'll be fine.

427
00:29:00,610 --> 00:29:02,290
“Fine” again—fine what?

428
00:29:02,750 --> 00:29:03,990
This is my mess to fix.

429
00:29:04,030 --> 00:29:05,030
Go.

430
00:29:18,820 --> 00:29:19,820
Dokkae.

431
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:20,880
Yes, sir.

432
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:26,160
You okay?

433
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:50,760
Toe.

434
00:31:52,460 --> 00:31:53,820
Did I tell you?

435
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:57,920
Something about you rubs me the wrong way.

436
00:32:15,420 --> 00:32:16,420
Sorry, Gyeong-do.

437
00:32:20,620 --> 00:32:21,620
See Yeon-ju home.

438
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:24,720
Uh… I actually want to stay with Chunsam...

439
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:24,760
It's okay.

440
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:25,800
Go.

441
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:45,580
Soo-an.

442
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:48,940
Take me to where the bosses are.

443
00:32:49,460 --> 00:32:50,760
Do you have to butt heads?

444
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:53,140
Please.

445
00:33:01,170 --> 00:33:04,210
Block the bank and they'll have no moves left, right?

446
00:33:04,770 --> 00:33:06,210
When's the re-auction?

447
00:33:06,970 --> 00:33:08,550
I arranged it for tomorrow.

448
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:21,240
Good to see you all again.

449
00:33:21,780 --> 00:33:23,380
I'm Kim Chunsam—the Beggar King.

450
00:33:26,890 --> 00:33:28,310
I'll get to the point.

451
00:33:28,610 --> 00:33:30,230
Please yield to me this time.

452
00:33:30,430 --> 00:33:31,430
If you can't…

453
00:33:34,310 --> 00:33:37,410
Then I'll have no choice but to stake my life...

454
00:33:37,450 --> 00:33:39,410
Are you threatening us?

455
00:33:40,970 --> 00:33:43,350
Since when has that worked on you, sir?

456
00:33:44,170 --> 00:33:45,170
Hey.

457
00:33:46,210 --> 00:33:48,830
We've handled contraband auctions for years.

458
00:33:49,470 --> 00:33:50,470
Why you, now?

459
00:33:53,070 --> 00:33:54,730
Just this once—please yield.

460
00:33:54,850 --> 00:33:57,030
After this, I won't stick my nose in again.

461
00:33:58,830 --> 00:33:59,930
Listen, Kim Chunsam...

462
00:34:00,790 --> 00:34:03,810
Why do you have to get these goods—what's your reason?

463
00:34:04,310 --> 00:34:09,550
As you know, I run an orphanage called Hapsimwon under Yeomcheon Bridge.

464
00:34:10,190 --> 00:34:13,890
It used to be a dye factory site in the Japanese era.
We've got no money, so we're about to be kicked out.

465
00:34:13,930 --> 00:34:14,590
The kids are starving…

466
00:34:14,630 --> 00:34:16,380
If that's the situation, same here.

467
00:34:17,090 --> 00:34:19,350
I've got over 2,300 mouths to feed.

468
00:34:51,010 --> 00:34:55,380
Back when we stuffed our
guts with dishwater and radish

469
00:34:55,400 --> 00:35:01,050
greens, finding one of these in the
trash heap made us go nuts with joy.

470
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:17,980
Remember slurping the wiggling maggots? How tasty it felt, Du-han?

471
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:23,060
Double-Blade, you remember that taste, right?

472
00:35:28,940 --> 00:35:33,600
If I give up the Japanese
auction, dozens of my kids will be

473
00:35:33,620 --> 00:35:38,760
back in sackcloth, roaming alleys
hunting for this kind of garbage.

474
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:41,720
I'm not just making excuses!

475
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:43,120
Business is business!

476
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:55,660
Then beat me and take it.

477
00:35:57,140 --> 00:35:59,420
I'm not scared of anything.

478
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:08,000
I was tortured by Japanese cops, did
time, and survived two weeks on tree roots.

479
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:13,920
In the war I crawled out of a burning tank to stay alive.

480
00:36:15,860 --> 00:36:16,940
Kill me and go.

481
00:36:32,420 --> 00:36:34,370
I'm going to the bank tomorrow morning.

482
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:38,860
I'll leave the final decision to you all.

483
00:37:19,930 --> 00:37:21,550
Wow, that's really something.

484
00:37:21,690 --> 00:37:22,090
Some business, huh?

485
00:37:22,130 --> 00:37:24,180
Sounded like a tank rolling by, for real.

486
00:37:26,370 --> 00:37:28,670
The hotel manager gave me this in the morning.

487
00:37:28,890 --> 00:37:29,990
What's this, the bill?

488
00:37:33,330 --> 00:37:35,390
That guy... he really didn't catch on, did he?

489
00:37:35,430 --> 00:37:39,530
When Raccoon said he'd make him boss,
he even hailed a cab for us on the way here.

490
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:40,590
Here, read this.

491
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:52,480
Boss, it's a letter from that woman, Yeon-ji.

492
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:28,880
Boss,

493
00:38:35,210 --> 00:38:39,590
You said you lost your older sister when you were little, right?

494
00:38:47,220 --> 00:38:49,420
That was 18 years ago already.

495
00:39:11,740 --> 00:39:15,220
Sis, sis, what are you doing?

496
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:16,280
Hurry up.

497
00:39:16,740 --> 00:39:17,740
Why?

498
00:39:59,550 --> 00:40:01,100
Let's go just a little further.

499
00:40:01,710 --> 00:40:03,710
Then stop wearing those rubber shoes.

500
00:40:04,550 --> 00:40:05,700
It's okay, let's hurry.

501
00:40:06,170 --> 00:40:08,670
My sister always told me stories about our mother.

502
00:40:08,750 --> 00:40:13,690
It was because of her that I always
missed the mother I could barely remember.

503
00:40:14,730 --> 00:40:19,830
I can't tell you how happy I was when she suggested
we go find our mother, who had remarried in Daegu.

504
00:40:20,350 --> 00:40:24,730
I thought we'd see her again just by crossing
a hill or two, like when we went to the market.

505
00:40:24,770 --> 00:40:27,650
What if we run into her and don't recognize each other?

506
00:40:27,690 --> 00:40:31,750
I thought if we just found our
mother, we'd never be hungry

507
00:40:31,770 --> 00:40:35,850
or get whipped by Grandma
again, and that we'd live happily.

508
00:40:37,630 --> 00:40:43,150
But that journey became the start
of a dark and treacherous path in life.

509
00:40:49,510 --> 00:40:50,510
It's a pheasant!

510
00:40:50,770 --> 00:40:53,670
Sis, who's the best anchovy-sorter in the whole world?

511
00:40:55,230 --> 00:40:56,230
Kim Chunsam.

512
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:40,300
Sis!

513
00:42:26,300 --> 00:42:27,950
That was the last time I saw her.

514
00:42:29,430 --> 00:42:32,080
I still don't really know what happened to my sister.

515
00:42:32,700 --> 00:42:40,380
After being separated from my sister, who was my friend
and a mother to me, I missed my real mother even more.

516
00:42:49,620 --> 00:42:50,980
You little bastard!

517
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:54,360
Get over here.

518
00:43:04,060 --> 00:43:05,660
Where were you headed, you brat?

519
00:43:32,010 --> 00:43:33,310
Hey, hey!

520
00:43:34,150 --> 00:43:34,690
Get up, kid.

521
00:43:34,890 --> 00:43:35,890
Come here.

522
00:43:41,590 --> 00:43:42,590
Hey, Beardy.

523
00:44:10,740 --> 00:44:11,740
Hey, Beardy.

524
00:44:12,020 --> 00:44:12,760
Bring the ladder.

525
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:13,890
Come here.

526
00:44:28,630 --> 00:44:29,810
Come here.

527
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:34,620
Come here.

528
00:44:34,660 --> 00:44:35,660
Bring the ladder.

529
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:40,520
Ah, it's heavy!

530
00:44:42,460 --> 00:44:43,260
Come here.

531
00:44:43,340 --> 00:44:44,980
Come here.

532
00:44:45,340 --> 00:44:46,340
Come here.

533
00:44:57,290 --> 00:44:58,820
Come here.

534
00:45:09,030 --> 00:45:11,260
As long as we have this, we'll be fine.

535
00:45:12,590 --> 00:45:13,940
Beardy, what are you doing?

536
00:45:47,700 --> 00:45:54,360
Forced to be the hunter's bait, I howled all
night and watched clearly what unfolded in that pit.

537
00:45:55,480 --> 00:45:59,540
A venomous badger fought a wolf
several times its size and didn't back down.

538
00:46:00,540 --> 00:46:03,630
It couldn't win with strength,
but it fought for its life,

539
00:46:03,650 --> 00:46:06,960
latching onto the wolf's throat
until it finally choked it out.

540
00:46:07,700 --> 00:46:10,040
If not with strength, you survive with guts.

541
00:46:11,300 --> 00:46:12,650
Our world is like that too.

542
00:46:13,700 --> 00:46:15,980
In the world of men, to lose is to die.

543
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:18,910
If you have no strength, you need guts.

544
00:46:24,460 --> 00:46:25,860
Ah, good work.

545
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:43,720
No!

546
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:44,760
Back then...

547
00:47:00,860 --> 00:47:07,880
I was like a loach on a fishhook, used as bait to catch a bigger fish.

548
00:47:08,920 --> 00:47:15,320
It was obvious that once I got a little older and was
no longer useful as bait, the hunters would kill me.

549
00:47:17,020 --> 00:47:18,160
To live, I had to run.

550
00:47:18,980 --> 00:47:22,400
But for a child alone, that was impossible.

551
00:47:23,560 --> 00:47:26,800
Bong-u, sing us a song.

552
00:47:27,740 --> 00:47:46,560
[Singing] In the blue sky's milky way, on
a white boat, there is one cinnamon tree...

553
00:48:41,480 --> 00:49:06,640
A tiger... it's a tiger, right?

554
00:49:25,020 --> 00:49:26,020
Here,

555
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:47,520
We've had our fun here. Let's get going.

556
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:53,740
That damn tiger raised hell all night,
so most of the prey must have fled.

557
00:50:02,740 --> 00:50:04,180
Hey, Beardy!

558
00:50:04,700 --> 00:50:05,180
What are you doing?

559
00:50:05,220 --> 00:50:06,220
Hurry up!

560
00:50:43,150 --> 00:50:45,690
Mr. Kim, I'm hungry.

561
00:50:48,610 --> 00:50:51,990
Beardy, have the kid start a fire.

562
00:50:52,230 --> 00:50:53,580
Let's get something to eat.

563
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:11,500
Put the bag down.

564
00:51:15,390 --> 00:51:18,440
Chunsam, you follow me and just run downhill, no matter what.

565
00:51:19,150 --> 00:51:20,150
Huh?

566
00:51:21,370 --> 00:51:25,890
Run to the stream down there, and don't look back.

567
00:51:26,330 --> 00:51:26,630
Got it?

568
00:51:27,110 --> 00:51:28,110
Yes.

569
00:51:44,220 --> 00:51:45,500
You damn kids!

570
00:51:46,060 --> 00:51:47,160
Mr. Kim!

571
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:49,980
Hey, Beardy!

572
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:51,200
Where are you going?

573
00:51:56,260 --> 00:51:57,800
Mr. Kim!

574
00:52:02,900 --> 00:52:05,700
Mr. Kim!

575
00:52:19,860 --> 00:52:21,260
Mister!

576
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:24,680
Mister!

577
00:52:30,890 --> 00:52:32,290
You

578
00:53:02,750 --> 00:53:05,430
damn kids!

579
00:53:29,880 --> 00:53:31,080
You damn kids!

580
00:53:31,880 --> 00:53:32,880
Spare me!

581
00:53:33,480 --> 00:53:34,480
Spare me!

582
00:53:35,320 --> 00:53:36,320
Don't kill me!

583
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:38,040
Spare me!

584
00:53:38,740 --> 00:53:39,740
Spare me!

585
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:40,680
Bring it on!

586
00:53:41,120 --> 00:53:42,120
Bring it on!

587
00:53:42,340 --> 00:53:43,340
Turn on the light!

588
00:53:44,020 --> 00:53:45,020
Bring it on!

589
00:57:58,480 --> 00:57:59,880
Hey!

590
00:58:00,800 --> 00:58:01,800
Hey!

591
00:58:02,020 --> 00:58:03,020
Who are you?

592
00:58:05,320 --> 00:58:06,860
Who do you work for?

593
00:58:07,680 --> 00:58:09,030
I said, where are you from!

594
00:58:10,560 --> 00:58:13,940
I'm not sure where I'm from, but where I'm going is Daegu.

595
00:58:14,760 --> 00:58:16,360
Hey, how far to Daegu from here?

596
00:58:17,600 --> 00:58:21,800
Can't believe there are still guys walking
around with words written on their faces.

597
00:58:22,620 --> 00:58:23,820
It's written right here.

598
00:58:23,900 --> 00:58:24,900
Hick.

599
00:58:27,750 --> 00:58:30,350
You know what the Government-General of Chōsen does?

600
00:58:31,210 --> 00:58:33,810
It takes care of the people and collects taxes.

601
00:58:34,610 --> 00:58:37,910
Around here, I'm the Government-General. So pay your taxes and go.

602
00:58:38,230 --> 00:58:42,210
You entered my territory. If you leave
without paying, you won't live to see old age.

603
00:58:42,250 --> 00:58:49,150
I can't pay taxes, but if you tell me
how to get to Daegu, I can give you this.

604
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:54,780
Do you even know how far Daegu is?

605
00:58:56,540 --> 00:58:57,660
Yeah, how far?

606
00:58:59,060 --> 00:59:00,560
Depends on whose legs you use.

607
00:59:01,600 --> 00:59:06,100
On your legs, it'll take till your 60th
birthday. On someone else's, it's just half a day.

608
00:59:07,380 --> 00:59:08,380
Someone else's legs?

609
00:59:08,540 --> 00:59:10,320
Why would you crawl there on your own legs?

610
00:59:10,360 --> 00:59:11,610
You have to take a train.

611
00:59:12,260 --> 00:59:12,560
A train?

612
00:59:13,300 --> 00:59:14,300
How?

613
00:59:15,900 --> 00:59:17,380
See that last car over there?

614
00:59:18,240 --> 00:59:20,080
Go and knock on the door.

615
00:59:20,220 --> 00:59:21,320
Someone will come out.

616
00:59:21,800 --> 00:59:23,480
Then tell them I sent you.

617
00:59:24,160 --> 00:59:26,060
They'll take you all the way to Daegu.

618
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:29,400
Got it, hick?

619
00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:32,280
Hey!

620
00:59:32,760 --> 00:59:33,810
Who the heck are you?

621
00:59:33,980 --> 00:59:34,200
Me?

622
00:59:34,980 --> 00:59:35,600
Parrot!

623
00:59:35,960 --> 00:59:38,360
Around here, say 'Parrot' and everyone knows me!

624
00:59:58,260 --> 00:59:59,260
What's your problem!

625
00:59:59,460 --> 01:00:01,310
What do you think you're doing, punk!

626
01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:04,000
Parrot sent me.

627
01:00:04,180 --> 01:00:05,180
What?

628
01:00:05,840 --> 01:00:07,880
Sir, I told you—Parrot sent me.

629
01:00:08,040 --> 01:00:09,390
Told you to give me a ride.

630
01:00:16,340 --> 01:00:17,660
Hey you, come here.

631
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:20,360
Who sent you?

632
01:00:20,760 --> 01:00:21,460
Be straight with me.

633
01:00:21,700 --> 01:00:22,780
Who put you up to this?

634
01:00:22,820 --> 01:00:23,820
Parrot did.

635
01:00:24,040 --> 01:00:25,940
Says we're taking him as far as Daegu.

636
01:00:26,440 --> 01:00:27,800
Mister, what are you doing?

637
01:00:27,920 --> 01:00:29,070
Don't leave me hanging.

638
01:00:29,140 --> 01:00:29,940
Can you just get in already?

639
01:00:29,980 --> 01:00:30,560
You too—get in!

640
01:00:30,780 --> 01:00:32,460
Why are you blocking the wheels there?

641
01:00:32,500 --> 01:00:33,500
What did you say?

642
01:00:33,760 --> 01:00:35,020
Where do you want a ride to?

643
01:00:35,060 --> 01:00:36,060
Daegu—Daegu.

644
01:00:36,300 --> 01:00:37,320
Parrot sent me.

645
01:00:38,340 --> 01:00:39,340
Damn…

646
01:00:39,980 --> 01:00:41,540
Sir, just take me to Daegu.

647
01:00:42,060 --> 01:00:43,520
I said Parrot sent me—Parrot!

648
01:00:43,600 --> 01:00:44,100
Hey, you lunatic!

649
01:00:44,220 --> 01:00:45,470
Parrot's headed that way?

650
01:00:45,640 --> 01:00:47,040
Daegu's this way—right here.

651
01:00:48,700 --> 01:00:49,860
Mister, is that true?

652
01:00:50,300 --> 01:00:51,400
Is this really Daegu?

653
01:00:51,800 --> 01:00:52,460
Aren't you leaving already?

654
01:00:52,720 --> 01:00:53,360
You want a beating?

655
01:00:53,400 --> 01:00:54,750
You little punk, seriously!

656
01:00:58,460 --> 01:00:59,460
Hang up!

657
01:01:04,020 --> 01:01:05,620
Hey girls, you do have belly buttons!

658
01:01:05,660 --> 01:01:06,660
You do!

659
01:01:07,840 --> 01:01:09,600
Beggars are brothers.

660
01:01:10,440 --> 01:01:14,900
Brothers beg together and split it even.

661
01:01:21,060 --> 01:01:24,840
This is scarier than guns and knives—so wield it well.

662
01:01:25,220 --> 01:01:26,220
Toe!

663
01:01:28,860 --> 01:01:29,860
Rat-Droppings!

664
01:01:31,480 --> 01:01:32,800
You killed him!

665
01:01:33,080 --> 01:01:33,720
With fists?

666
01:01:33,800 --> 01:01:34,800
Or with guts?

667
01:01:37,300 --> 01:01:38,300
Hey, you punk
