1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:02,050
Mister, is this for real?

2
00:00:02,380 --> 00:00:03,520
Is this really Daegu?

3
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:04,540
Aren't you going to get lost?

4
00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:06,230
You want a beating, you brat!

5
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:10,410
Ah!

6
00:00:10,450 --> 00:00:11,450
It's Daegu!

7
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:27,900
Get your sweet potatoes!

8
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:33,960
Give me some sweet potatoes.

9
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:35,160
Yes.

10
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:37,220
Ma'am, cow dung!

11
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:38,340
Cow dung!

12
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:43,160
Ma'am, here's your handbag.

13
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:44,320
Oh, thank you.

14
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:47,200
Hey, my ring!

15
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:47,880
Oh!

16
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:49,060
Oh, thank you!

17
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,140
Hey, lady! Do you know where you are?

18
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:52,780
How dare you cause a scene here?

19
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:24,540
Why did you lie?

20
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:25,600
This is Daegu.

21
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:26,540
Give me back my apple.

22
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:27,830
What's with this kid?

23
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:31,420
Think getting that "hick" sign off your forehead was free?

24
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:32,600
Give me back my apple!

25
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:34,600
Why is this yours?

26
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:38,330
I put my teeth marks on it, so it's mine.

27
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:40,900
Give it back.

28
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:43,680
Get lost!

29
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:45,440
Give me back the apple.

30
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:46,040
No!

31
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:47,460
Get lost!

32
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:57,320
Boss!

33
00:01:58,100 --> 00:01:59,100
What's this?

34
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,960
Parrot, did your little chick show up?

35
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:18,740
You gonna look?

36
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:19,780
You gonna look?

37
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:22,820
It'll get jinxed if you guys look...

38
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:23,460
No!

39
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:24,500
Let's see!

40
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:26,280
Let's see!

41
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:26,980
Let's see!

42
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:27,680
Let's see!

43
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:28,920
Let me see!

44
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:29,680
No!

45
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:30,640
Be quiet.

46
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:31,140
Let me see!

47
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,360
I said let me see!

48
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:33,460
Hey!

49
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:37,140
Bring that over here.

50
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,160
Hurry up and bring it!

51
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,450
Or I'll wring your damn neck!

52
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,240
It's the Boss!

53
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,520
It's the Boss!

54
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:46,680
It's the Boss!

55
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:47,180
Boss!

56
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:47,740
Boss!

57
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:48,200
What is it?

58
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:48,780
Is there no one with you?

59
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:50,340
Loma!

60
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:11,480
Lay out your bowls.

61
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:12,480
What are you saying?

62
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,240
Put it all out.

63
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:16,420
Rat Droppings!

64
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,540
That's it? You're useless.

65
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:29,960
Midal!

66
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:34,020
Next up, Loach!

67
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:41,770
One scoop of rice, a handful of barley, three pieces of rice cake.

68
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:44,050
There's a dried pollack head here, too.

69
00:03:44,330 --> 00:03:46,850
The pollack head passes. Pass.

70
00:03:47,990 --> 00:03:48,450
Scraps!

71
00:03:49,010 --> 00:03:50,010
Yes.

72
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:56,420
Boss, please give this kid a piece of cloth.

73
00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:14,090
What good is bringing back just one?

74
00:04:14,690 --> 00:04:15,810
No, sir.

75
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:17,890
I'll bring back a cleaner one.

76
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:20,350
The other one was too dirty, so I threw it out.

77
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:22,190
Leave it here, kid.

78
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:24,170
Parrot.

79
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:25,370
Yes?

80
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:30,450
One bowl of soup, two pieces of barley, half a stick of taffy.

81
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:34,190
And a one-jeon jujube.

82
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:40,090
You're a beggar sent from heaven.

83
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:42,310
Come here.

84
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:50,920
Wow, Parrot got praised. He must be happy.

85
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:53,260
What about your selfish hoarding, Yellow?

86
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:56,680
I saw everything at the station earlier.

87
00:04:56,780 --> 00:04:57,780
No, that's not it.

88
00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:02,260
The birds were chasing me, so I dropped it while I was running away.

89
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:17,420
Pour it.

90
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:18,860
Yes.

91
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:43,000
If Yellow really shows up, what happens to Parrot?

92
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:45,380
He won't be able to beg for another month.

93
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:48,480
The Boss will yank out both his fangs.

94
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:50,560
Take off your pants too, punk.

95
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:55,640
Come here.

96
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:01,860
Parrot, look me straight in the eyes.

97
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:04,260
Straight!

98
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:08,420
If you lie, you die.

99
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:19,140
Toe, bring me a skewer.

100
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:21,500
Hey, bring a skewer.

101
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:33,820
Lie down properly!

102
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:39,000
Now, let's take a look at your bare ass.

103
00:06:47,227 --> 00:06:49,123
It's true!

104
00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:55,469
I was running because I thought the guy
with the birds would catch me, and I dropped it!

105
00:06:57,670 --> 00:06:58,830
Is that true?

106
00:06:59,070 --> 00:07:00,070
Yes.

107
00:07:06,633 --> 00:07:08,733
Maybe his mouth is just shaped for lying?

108
00:07:33,733 --> 00:07:36,033
Beggars are brothers.

109
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:42,680
Brothers beg together and share everything equally.

110
00:07:44,273 --> 00:07:45,273
Got it?

111
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,480
Yes.

112
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:47,360
Got it?

113
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:48,580
Yes.

114
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:02,490
Take care.

115
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,480
What the...?

116
00:08:21,923 --> 00:08:23,043
What's going on?

117
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:25,730
What's happening?

118
00:08:25,890 --> 00:08:27,370
Shake 'em all awake!

119
00:08:27,410 --> 00:08:28,860
Where have you been sleeping?

120
00:08:29,230 --> 00:08:30,410
Hey, shake 'em all.

121
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:32,390
This punk...

122
00:08:32,830 --> 00:08:33,570
Shake 'em all awake!

123
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:34,710
Shake 'em all awake!

124
00:08:57,412 --> 00:08:58,632
Alright, that's enough.

125
00:08:59,646 --> 00:09:00,966
Stop it and sleep!

126
00:09:05,311 --> 00:09:09,640
I'd have no regrets if I could just have some hot soup.

127
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:16,940
I don't even need it to be hot. If I could just have one sip of soup...

128
00:09:19,793 --> 00:09:22,933
I'm getting hungrier because I can't sleep.

129
00:09:24,153 --> 00:09:28,703
It's not that you're hungry because you can't
sleep. You can't sleep because you're hungry.

130
00:09:31,466 --> 00:09:34,346
Why am I always hungry, even after I've eaten?

131
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:39,960
You idiot. Beggars have a hunger ghost attached
to them. You can't not be hungry even if you want to.

132
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:42,280
Stop talking nonsense and go to sleep.

133
00:09:43,393 --> 00:09:46,133
Should we play the rice cake naming game?

134
00:09:47,099 --> 00:09:48,099
Shut up.

135
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,080
Are you crazy?

136
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:55,650
My back and stomach are already stuck together,
and you want to brag about rice cakes? What the hell?

137
00:09:56,160 --> 00:10:00,180
Injeolmi. Is injeolmi a rice cake?

138
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:01,920
Yes, it's a rice cake.

139
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:04,840
Steamed rice cake.

140
00:10:05,386 --> 00:10:06,386
Right.

141
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,640
Glutinous rice cake.

142
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:14,320
White rice cake, the one we eat on New Year's Day.

143
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:17,600
Hotteok.

144
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:20,240
Hotteok isn't a rice cake, it's bread.

145
00:10:20,979 --> 00:10:24,479
They sell hotteok at bakeries, not rice cake shops.

146
00:10:24,579 --> 00:10:25,919
So it's bread.

147
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:30,120
Hotteok is a type of dog rice cake.
It doesn't matter where they sell it.

148
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,160
Dog.

149
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:33,140
It's Toe's turn to sleep.

150
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:34,480
Hurry up and sleep.

151
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:35,780
Lights out.

152
00:10:38,525 --> 00:10:40,183
Hotteok is a rice cake, too.

153
00:10:45,479 --> 00:10:47,072
Hotteok is not a rice cake.

154
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:48,220
You lose.

155
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:53,880
Then...

156
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:57,700
Is bindaetteok a rice cake?

157
00:11:08,702 --> 00:11:11,742
Hey, where did Injeolmi go?

158
00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:15,470
Maybe he went to take a leak.

159
00:11:16,450 --> 00:11:20,370
That kid looks dazed, but he's got no sense.

160
00:11:26,956 --> 00:11:28,356
What's this kid doing?

161
00:11:30,902 --> 00:11:31,922
It's the Boss!

162
00:11:59,043 --> 00:12:00,243
Did you guys do this?

163
00:12:03,483 --> 00:12:04,863
Did you guys do this?

164
00:12:06,130 --> 00:12:07,180
Did you guys do this?

165
00:12:13,146 --> 00:12:14,426
You damn punks!

166
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:30,320
Your stomachs must be empty.

167
00:12:37,986 --> 00:12:38,986
Eat.

168
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:41,360
Let him eat.

169
00:12:49,130 --> 00:12:53,580
If any of you lay a finger on him, I won't let it slide!

170
00:12:58,383 --> 00:13:00,163
Hey, bring him here.

171
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:04,450
What's wrong?

172
00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:05,630
Let go!

173
00:13:05,810 --> 00:13:07,110
Can't you shut your mouth?

174
00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:13,050
Let go, you bastard!

175
00:13:13,090 --> 00:13:14,090
Shut up!

176
00:13:34,946 --> 00:13:36,506
You're dead if you get caught.

177
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:43,040
I'm thirsty. Go get some water from those guys.

178
00:13:56,510 --> 00:13:59,230
If you don't want to get beaten to death by the Boss...

179
00:13:59,270 --> 00:14:00,810
tell him you weren't hit.

180
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:02,090
Got it?

181
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,680
Did they hit you again?

182
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:33,880
You damn punks!

183
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:34,980
No, that's not it.

184
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:45,520
I fell down.

185
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:49,100
Is that true?

186
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:51,060
Yes.

187
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:58,800
Hey, Anchovy, give him something to eat.

188
00:15:08,290 --> 00:15:10,370
What are you most afraid of in the world?

189
00:15:12,270 --> 00:15:19,010
A strong fist? A rich guy? That's all bullshit.

190
00:15:20,690 --> 00:15:24,250
The scariest thing in the world is hunger.

191
00:15:27,410 --> 00:15:31,650
If a drunk dog and a hungry dog fight, who do you think wins?

192
00:15:33,310 --> 00:15:34,770
The hungry dog wins.

193
00:15:36,530 --> 00:15:37,530
You know why?

194
00:15:39,290 --> 00:15:49,471
When your stomach is empty, you see nothing and
fear nothing. As scary as hunger is, having a full stomach

195
00:15:49,491 --> 00:15:59,310
feels amazing and makes life worth living. That's
why beggars are the most blessed people in the world.

196
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:06,070
Because you know how scary hunger is and how good a full stomach feels.

197
00:16:07,430 --> 00:16:09,930
Isn't your heart more at peace than even Buddha's?

198
00:16:14,670 --> 00:16:16,210
Take this.

199
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:28,380
From now on, this begging gourd
will be a weapon more fearsome

200
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:32,880
than any gun or knife. Go out
there and wield this weapon well.

201
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:38,420
The beggar who came last year...

202
00:16:44,190 --> 00:16:57,220
Let's rest, rest, and go in. The
beggar who came last year is

203
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:10,710
back again without dying. Let's
rest, rest, and go in. First up!

204
00:17:12,430 --> 00:17:14,570
Hey, have a good day.

205
00:17:14,830 --> 00:17:16,070
You guys have a Chuseok house today, right?

206
00:17:16,110 --> 00:17:16,410
Got it.

207
00:17:16,510 --> 00:17:17,270
Let's watch together.

208
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:17,830
Hey, Yeong-se.

209
00:17:18,410 --> 00:17:19,410
Train him well.

210
00:17:19,630 --> 00:17:20,630
I will.

211
00:17:23,810 --> 00:17:25,950
You should know you're incredibly lucky.

212
00:17:27,050 --> 00:17:30,350
Having a beggar as skilled as me in all of Joseon as your teacher.

213
00:17:30,810 --> 00:17:31,810
Watch carefully.

214
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:40,380
Punk, that's not it.

215
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:43,000
Those aren't the eyes of a beggar.

216
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:46,300
You think you can just look with those wide-open eyes?

217
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:51,360
It's a sin for a beggar not to look like a beggar.

218
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:57,120
To be a beggar, you have to walk
like a beggar, and breathe like a beggar.

219
00:17:57,340 --> 00:17:58,340
Got it?

220
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:02,640
To look truly pathetic like a real beggar, look at me, look at me.

221
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:06,970
Let your eyes droop, and your mouth...

222
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,160
Forget it.

223
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:10,200
I'll just do it my way.

224
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:13,390
Hey, hey! If you do as I say, even if you don't have parents...

225
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:14,720
You're my student, punk!

226
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:20,040
My yellow cloth!

227
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:22,670
What are you going to do with this?

228
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:25,860
When I was little, a fortune teller told me.

229
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:31,140
If I don't carry something yellow on me, an
evil spirit will attach itself to me and I'll die.

230
00:18:35,330 --> 00:18:36,330
Thanks.

231
00:18:37,710 --> 00:18:40,450
I'll make you the most skilled beggar there is.

232
00:18:41,630 --> 00:18:46,270
When it comes to begging, scrap metal,
and other skills, no one can match me.

233
00:18:46,930 --> 00:18:48,180
I don't need any of that.

234
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:50,250
Then what can I do for you?

235
00:18:50,290 --> 00:18:51,940
Just say the word, I'll grant it.

236
00:18:53,610 --> 00:18:55,610
I only want one thing.

237
00:18:57,870 --> 00:18:59,030
Please look here.

238
00:18:59,790 --> 00:19:02,270
This young man here has come to find his mother.

239
00:19:02,990 --> 00:19:05,940
His name is Kim Chunsam, and his mother's name is Park-sil.

240
00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:07,790
Open your eyes and look carefully.

241
00:19:07,830 --> 00:19:11,610
Has anyone lost a son as handsome as a Formica doll?

242
00:19:12,210 --> 00:19:14,790
Chunsam, Sansam, whatever. No one here has lost a son.

243
00:19:14,830 --> 00:19:16,580
Just make some noise and get going.

244
00:19:21,350 --> 00:19:24,450
That lady, even if I don't give her a
burnt rice crust, she's always yelling.

245
00:19:24,490 --> 00:19:25,810
What's that punk saying?

246
00:19:26,330 --> 00:19:30,450
If we just go around the laundromats and
markets, we can meet all the women in the world.

247
00:19:30,490 --> 00:19:33,890
Even if your mom sleeps in and doesn't leave the house, don't worry.

248
00:19:34,790 --> 00:19:36,550
Aren't women all talk, anyway?

249
00:19:37,070 --> 00:19:41,170
They know more about who lost a son in
whose house than they know about their own.

250
00:19:44,010 --> 00:19:45,550
This is money, you punk.

251
00:19:48,910 --> 00:19:51,350
Ma'am, I brought the fermented urine water.

252
00:19:53,010 --> 00:19:54,630
Oh, you're here.

253
00:19:55,290 --> 00:19:57,710
I was just about to wash the holiday clothes.

254
00:19:57,910 --> 00:19:58,910
Perfect timing.

255
00:20:01,010 --> 00:20:02,010
Here you go.

256
00:20:02,690 --> 00:20:03,690
Thank you.

257
00:20:04,290 --> 00:20:05,290
Off you go.

258
00:20:12,610 --> 00:20:13,610
Two.

259
00:20:14,670 --> 00:20:15,670
One.

260
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:16,830
Two.

261
00:20:17,930 --> 00:20:18,130
Three.

262
00:20:18,170 --> 00:20:19,170
Four.

263
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:22,250
Get up.

264
00:20:22,510 --> 00:20:23,330
What are you talking about?

265
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:24,430
Yes, thank you.

266
00:20:25,030 --> 00:20:26,030
Come here.

267
00:20:27,290 --> 00:20:28,870
This is where they keep the props.

268
00:20:28,910 --> 00:20:30,160
You pack up quickly, too.

269
00:20:32,990 --> 00:20:34,750
This is the loan shark's house.

270
00:20:35,450 --> 00:20:39,250
Since he's a damn loan shark, you
have to piss on it every time you pass by.

271
00:20:39,290 --> 00:20:41,390
It's even better if you take a dump on it.

272
00:20:49,590 --> 00:20:52,510
Rest, rest, and here we go.

273
00:20:52,870 --> 00:20:55,610
Rest, rest, and here we go.

274
00:20:56,030 --> 00:20:59,030
Chunsam, who came last year,

275
00:21:02,610 --> 00:21:04,750
has come to find his mother.

276
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:09,190
He came all the way to Daegu.

277
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:22,960
We're screwed again today.

278
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:24,680
It's only been three days.

279
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:26,490
Do you know how big Daegu is?

280
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:29,400
It'll take more than a month to search everywhere.

281
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:31,920
Oh, Chunsam.

282
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:35,580
Oh, Chunsam.

283
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:37,180
Oh...

284
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:40,340
Oh, my baby, where have you been?

285
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:49,160
Oh, you're nothing but skin and bones. Your spirit is completely gone.

286
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:53,020
Oh, you look worse for wear than a wild beast.

287
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:55,940
Oh, my poor baby.

288
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:06,520
Oh, this mother hasn't been able to sleep a single
night with her legs stretched out since I lost you.

289
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:14,755
Every night, I'd curl up like a
frog, soaking my blanket with tears.

290
00:22:14,775 --> 00:22:21,580
Oh, now that I've found you, there's
nothing more to say, Chunsam.

291
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:23,300
Oh, my poor baby.

292
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:27,820
Mom... are you really my mom?

293
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:30,100
Of course, of course.

294
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:31,490
Let's go home, quickly.

295
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:36,060
Anchovy, I've repaid my debt now.

296
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:45,220
I'll say you ran away, so you have to live well with your mom.

297
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:47,600
Oh, don't you worry.

298
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:53,400
Anchovy, you're so lucky.

299
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,900
You have a mom now...

300
00:22:55,940 --> 00:23:00,980
Take care, you punk!

301
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:06,320
Oh, my frog-like son.

302
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:09,920
Every night, as soon as the sun went down, I'd lie down.

303
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:12,530
Hoping to meet you even in my dreams.

304
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:15,040
But now I've finally met you in person.

305
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:18,420
Hey, what's this?

306
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:20,220
You're not a beggar anymore.

307
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:21,260
Give that to me.

308
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:26,810
The house is a mess, right?

309
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:28,320
Oh,

310
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:34,810
There's no man around to fix things.

311
00:23:35,270 --> 00:23:36,810
So the outside is a mess.

312
00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:44,990
Mother...

313
00:23:49,450 --> 00:23:50,610
My sister...

314
00:23:52,470 --> 00:23:53,610
My sister...

315
00:23:53,650 --> 00:23:56,230
Oh dear, why are you asking about your sister?

316
00:23:57,250 --> 00:24:00,570
She fell off a cliff while being chased by hunters...

317
00:24:04,010 --> 00:24:06,090
Oh my goodness.

318
00:24:06,170 --> 00:24:07,910
What are we to do?

319
00:24:08,810 --> 00:24:10,610
Mother, I'm sorry.

320
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:13,690
No, it's not your fault.

321
00:24:14,470 --> 00:24:15,530
Forget about it.

322
00:24:15,810 --> 00:24:17,190
What's the use of a girl?

323
00:24:17,590 --> 00:24:19,290
I have a strong son like you here.

324
00:24:22,230 --> 00:24:23,910
But still, my sister...

325
00:24:23,950 --> 00:24:25,500
Stop talking about your sister.

326
00:24:26,030 --> 00:24:27,530
It'll only break your heart.

327
00:24:27,670 --> 00:24:28,770
What good will it do?

328
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:31,150
Hey, you must be hungry.

329
00:24:31,190 --> 00:24:31,610
Go inside.

330
00:24:31,670 --> 00:24:33,070
I'll prepare a meal for you.

331
00:24:36,290 --> 00:24:37,690
Can't you speak?

332
00:24:38,130 --> 00:24:39,130
Yes.

333
00:24:41,150 --> 00:24:44,580
Hey, when was the last time you ate a proper meal?

334
00:24:46,070 --> 00:24:47,070
I don't know.

335
00:24:47,910 --> 00:24:48,970
The day before yesterday?

336
00:24:49,010 --> 00:24:50,560
Then what have you been eating?

337
00:24:52,150 --> 00:24:55,530
Rice water, cabbage scraps, radish tops...

338
00:24:55,810 --> 00:24:56,810
Oh my, oh my.

339
00:24:57,130 --> 00:25:02,480
They say if someone who hasn't eaten well suddenly
eats a lot, their stomach gets shocked and they can die.

340
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:04,360
You're my precious son.

341
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:06,210
Something bad could happen.

342
00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:11,940
Make sure to chew each bite a hundred times.

343
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:16,080
If your stomach settles, this mother will give you all her rice.

344
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:17,440
Yes.

345
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:23,980
Living alone, this mother has suffered terribly just to survive.

346
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:28,140
You must take good care of your mother and be a good son.

347
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:29,440
Yes.

348
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:34,020
But, Mother, your new husband, my father...

349
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:34,580
Oh my.

350
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:35,770
Don't even mention him.

351
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:38,580
He caught a disease and died within two years.

352
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:43,080
Oh, this mother has no luck with husbands.

353
00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:45,670
A tiger startled by a hedgehog...

354
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:47,890
will even jump at a chestnut burr.

355
00:25:48,220 --> 00:25:51,070
Now, I just get a fright even seeing a mountain's shadow.

356
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:59,700
Oh my, you've eaten so much.

357
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:01,980
Maybe a sleep demon has possessed you.

358
00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:04,420
Oh my, oh my, oh my.

359
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:08,260
But, Mother...

360
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:09,740
Hmm?

361
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:13,470
If you're done eating, go over there and sleep.

362
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:15,920
What if my sister...

363
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:17,900
Didn't I tell you to stop talking about your sister?

364
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:18,940
She's dead.

365
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:20,420
Are you going to stop or not?

366
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:21,700
The living must go on.

367
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:24,140
Oh, my back.

368
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:25,320
Oh, oh.

369
00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:27,900
My neuralgia is acting up again.

370
00:26:33,190 --> 00:26:34,190
Black frog.

371
00:26:56,380 --> 00:26:57,380
Sis!

372
00:27:09,970 --> 00:27:10,970
Yes.

373
00:27:11,090 --> 00:27:12,690
Get up and eat something.

374
00:27:13,050 --> 00:27:15,130
The sun is high in the sky. If you keep sleeping like that,

375
00:27:15,170 --> 00:27:17,430
you and I will end up starving.

376
00:27:17,710 --> 00:27:18,490
No, I'm strong.

377
00:27:18,730 --> 00:27:19,730
Oh, hey, that hurts.

378
00:27:20,130 --> 00:27:26,050
Oh, with your mother's back aching from
neuralgia, you should have at least started a fire.

379
00:27:26,190 --> 00:27:28,170
I'm afraid the floor will get cold.

380
00:27:28,830 --> 00:27:29,970
Hey, hey, put me down.

381
00:27:30,650 --> 00:27:32,810
You know you're like a pumpkin vine.

382
00:27:33,630 --> 00:27:36,470
This mother worked her butt off to bring this here.

383
00:27:37,290 --> 00:27:39,190
Even the king can't get this for free.

384
00:27:41,190 --> 00:27:44,030
Chunsam, you go clean the pigsty.

385
00:27:44,410 --> 00:27:47,460
If you leave it like that, the pig will die in its own filth.

386
00:27:48,390 --> 00:27:49,390
Hurry.

387
00:28:11,050 --> 00:28:14,010
My, my, our Chunsam is strong as an ox.

388
00:28:14,270 --> 00:28:15,510
That's enough.

389
00:28:15,970 --> 00:28:18,270
Now, go to the mountain and get some firewood.

390
00:28:18,750 --> 00:28:24,690
Your mother's neuralgia makes it hard
to move, and I couldn't sleep all night.

391
00:28:25,530 --> 00:28:26,530
Yes.

392
00:28:28,330 --> 00:28:31,730
The more I think about it, the crazier it seems.

393
00:28:32,150 --> 00:28:37,810
That person is different from others. Do
you think I'd sell it for a penny to just anyone?

394
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:40,730
Still, it seems too expensive.

395
00:28:41,210 --> 00:28:42,210
Oh, come on.

396
00:28:42,310 --> 00:28:44,830
I'll throw in this hairpin for you.

397
00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:47,050
Alright, see you next time.

398
00:28:47,470 --> 00:28:48,470
Yeah.

399
00:28:49,210 --> 00:28:52,210
Mother, I brought back a lot of branches and pine needles.

400
00:28:53,150 --> 00:28:54,630
Oh, you've worked hard.

401
00:28:54,730 --> 00:28:55,730
Tired, aren't you?

402
00:28:56,290 --> 00:28:56,750
No.

403
00:28:57,190 --> 00:28:59,740
Whatever Mother asks me to do is not tiring at all.

404
00:28:59,870 --> 00:29:03,730
Oh, why do you always say the exact same things your father used to?

405
00:29:03,990 --> 00:29:05,290
You're so alike.

406
00:29:07,090 --> 00:29:09,950
Oh, I guess the spirits didn't mess up.

407
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:12,810
Mother, your back hurts, so go lie down.

408
00:29:13,290 --> 00:29:14,370
I'll make dinner.

409
00:29:15,890 --> 00:29:17,340
Oh, look at me, so forgetful.

410
00:29:17,690 --> 00:29:19,050
You must be so hungry.

411
00:29:20,230 --> 00:29:23,590
Hey, Chunsam, go cook the pig slop.

412
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:26,830
Yes.

413
00:30:37,350 --> 00:30:38,750
Do you have a place to stay?

414
00:30:39,850 --> 00:30:40,850
Oh.

415
00:30:41,510 --> 00:30:42,790
What brings you here?

416
00:30:43,810 --> 00:30:46,010
Didn't I tell you to wait there?

417
00:30:46,850 --> 00:30:48,090
That's what I was told.

418
00:30:48,950 --> 00:30:50,450
What can I do? I was getting anxious.

419
00:30:50,490 --> 00:30:51,190
Shut up, punk.

420
00:30:51,410 --> 00:30:52,410
Please, hurry.

421
00:31:00,630 --> 00:31:02,810
Does that beggar kid even work hard?

422
00:31:03,210 --> 00:31:03,710
Well...

423
00:31:04,170 --> 00:31:06,320
I'm living like a dog under a big tree now.

424
00:31:07,890 --> 00:31:11,410
A notoriously stingy woman like you? What's going on?

425
00:31:12,330 --> 00:31:17,270
Why would you bring in a kid you're not
even related to and cause such a scene?

426
00:31:17,310 --> 00:31:23,970
No, if I just wait a bit, he'll grow into a strong
young man. What could be better than this?

427
00:31:24,770 --> 00:31:30,130
No need for wages, and if he gets sick
from eating scraps, I can just kick him out.

428
00:31:30,350 --> 00:31:31,090
Come here.

429
00:31:31,250 --> 00:31:31,650
Oh, oh.

430
00:31:31,910 --> 00:31:33,290
Oh, he's so demanding.

431
00:31:34,690 --> 00:31:36,370
Come here.

432
00:31:36,510 --> 00:31:37,110
Oh, oh.

433
00:31:37,470 --> 00:31:38,470
That tickles.

434
00:31:49,950 --> 00:31:56,010
Chunsam, there's rice and side dishes in the
kitchen, so help yourself. I'll be back by sunset.

435
00:31:57,850 --> 00:31:59,170
Oh, you scared me.

436
00:31:59,390 --> 00:32:00,770
Oh, you nearly gave me a heart attack.

437
00:32:00,810 --> 00:32:01,810
Mother.

438
00:32:01,970 --> 00:32:02,970
What?

439
00:32:03,650 --> 00:32:06,770
There was something I wanted to ask you when I found you.

440
00:32:07,610 --> 00:32:09,610
Hey, stopping a busy person like this...

441
00:32:09,810 --> 00:32:11,030
We can talk about that later...

442
00:32:11,070 --> 00:32:12,070
When is my birthday?

443
00:32:13,790 --> 00:32:14,790
Your birthday?

444
00:32:15,650 --> 00:32:17,850
Well, let me see...

445
00:32:20,090 --> 00:32:22,930
It was well after the first month.

446
00:32:23,810 --> 00:32:26,570
Oh, it must have been around spring.

447
00:32:27,730 --> 00:32:31,530
Uh, maybe early March?

448
00:32:33,050 --> 00:32:37,430
Oh, I'll tell you the exact date after I get back from my errand.

449
00:32:37,630 --> 00:32:39,580
My grandmother said it was in the fall.

450
00:32:39,970 --> 00:32:41,690
When the persimmons were ripe.

451
00:32:43,610 --> 00:32:45,590
Oh, that's right, that's right.

452
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:48,230
Right, your sister was born in the spring.

453
00:32:48,610 --> 00:32:50,450
You were born in the fall, that's right.

454
00:32:50,490 --> 00:32:51,490
What day?

455
00:32:52,930 --> 00:32:53,930
Well, let me see...

456
00:32:56,950 --> 00:33:00,690
Hey, what are you doing, stopping a person with a long way to go?

457
00:33:01,390 --> 00:33:02,840
I'll tell you in the evening.

458
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:31,160
No,

459
00:34:15,550 --> 00:34:17,100
Girls don't have belly buttons.

460
00:34:17,370 --> 00:34:18,770
That's why they wear skirts.

461
00:34:19,070 --> 00:34:20,790
If they don't have belly buttons, why wear skirts?

462
00:34:20,830 --> 00:34:23,019
You idiot, since they don't
have a belly button for air to pass

463
00:34:23,039 --> 00:34:25,110
through, they wear skirts so it
can pass through from below.

464
00:34:25,150 --> 00:34:26,470
So girls have belly buttons?

465
00:34:26,510 --> 00:34:26,770
No.

466
00:34:26,930 --> 00:34:27,930
Yes.

467
00:34:30,130 --> 00:34:32,810
If you don't know anything, just stay quiet, you punks.

468
00:34:32,850 --> 00:34:34,950
Girls have belly buttons.

469
00:34:35,270 --> 00:34:36,270
Have you seen one?

470
00:34:37,330 --> 00:34:39,370
Later, a baby comes out of there, pop!

471
00:34:39,670 --> 00:34:40,390
That's how it works.

472
00:34:40,510 --> 00:34:41,510
Got it, you punk?

473
00:34:43,330 --> 00:34:44,890
That one's thick.

474
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:45,870
How much is it?

475
00:34:46,030 --> 00:34:47,030
How much?

476
00:34:47,570 --> 00:34:48,570
How much?

477
00:34:48,710 --> 00:34:49,710
How much?

478
00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:52,590
It's a watermelon.

479
00:34:52,710 --> 00:34:54,160
It's a watermelon, you punks.

480
00:34:55,430 --> 00:34:56,590
Let go, you bastards.

481
00:34:56,630 --> 00:34:57,630
You punks.

482
00:35:00,210 --> 00:35:01,450
Let go, you bastards.

483
00:35:04,970 --> 00:35:08,970
Even if you found a job, you should have
asked for my permission before leaving.

484
00:35:09,370 --> 00:35:10,470
Why did you come back?

485
00:35:10,870 --> 00:35:11,870
What happened?

486
00:35:13,250 --> 00:35:14,350
She was a fake mother.

487
00:35:19,830 --> 00:35:21,150
You're lucky to be alive.

488
00:35:22,550 --> 00:35:23,550
Are you okay?

489
00:35:24,630 --> 00:35:25,630
Yes.

490
00:35:28,670 --> 00:35:29,670
Toe.

491
00:35:29,910 --> 00:35:30,910
Yes.

492
00:35:31,990 --> 00:35:34,740
Divide what's left of Anchovy's share among the others.

493
00:35:35,070 --> 00:35:36,070
Yes.

494
00:35:38,730 --> 00:35:40,950
Pollack, Loach, go get the rice.

495
00:35:41,970 --> 00:35:43,310
Are there fake mothers?

496
00:35:43,870 --> 00:35:46,130
I wish I had a mother, even a fake one.

497
00:35:46,370 --> 00:35:47,370
I have one.

498
00:35:47,850 --> 00:35:50,370
A really pretty one. I have a real mother.

499
00:35:50,650 --> 00:35:51,650
Stop lying.

500
00:35:51,790 --> 00:35:53,490
How could a kid like you have a mother?

501
00:35:53,530 --> 00:35:54,530
It's true.

502
00:35:54,710 --> 00:35:56,630
Do you want to go see my mom right now?

503
00:35:56,670 --> 00:35:57,670
Don't bluff.

504
00:35:57,730 --> 00:35:59,870
Is your mom prettier than a courtesan?

505
00:36:00,010 --> 00:36:02,750
Of course. A courtesan isn't even
as pretty as the sole of my mom's foot.

506
00:36:02,790 --> 00:36:05,090
Is she prettier than the schoolgirls in sailor uniforms?

507
00:36:05,130 --> 00:36:06,630
Prettier than the schoolgirls?

508
00:36:09,090 --> 00:36:13,030
Not even as pretty as the sole of my mom's foot.

509
00:36:13,110 --> 00:36:13,990
Not even as pretty as the sole of my mom's foot.

510
00:36:14,030 --> 00:36:14,770
Hey, hey, let's go!

511
00:36:15,030 --> 00:36:16,030
Run, run!

512
00:36:16,350 --> 00:36:17,410
Run, run!

513
00:36:28,350 --> 00:36:30,450
Have you ever heard of a drifting water weed?

514
00:36:30,490 --> 00:36:32,340
Oh, please don't use difficult words.

515
00:36:32,610 --> 00:36:34,490
We don't understand difficult things.

516
00:36:34,730 --> 00:36:36,280
It's difficult, very difficult.

517
00:36:36,430 --> 00:36:37,530
Ah, this is annoying.

518
00:36:37,850 --> 00:36:38,310
Sigh.

519
00:36:38,570 --> 00:36:39,570
Oh, how annoying.

520
00:36:40,230 --> 00:36:43,030
Today Daejeon, tomorrow Gyeongseong.

521
00:36:43,530 --> 00:36:46,980
The loneliness of this drifting water weed, wandering here and there.

522
00:36:50,370 --> 00:36:51,470
Which one is your mom?

523
00:36:52,110 --> 00:36:53,530
That old lady?

524
00:36:53,950 --> 00:36:54,950
Are your eyes blind?

525
00:36:55,570 --> 00:36:56,670
Just you wait and see.

526
00:36:58,330 --> 00:36:59,750
Oh, there she is. My mom.

527
00:37:01,870 --> 00:37:03,750
I told you, she's a drifting water weed.

528
00:37:03,790 --> 00:37:04,210
Let go.

529
00:37:04,650 --> 00:37:06,510
Why don't you just settle down?

530
00:37:06,590 --> 00:37:07,210
Mother.

531
00:37:07,250 --> 00:37:09,130
Ugh, let go of me.

532
00:37:09,630 --> 00:37:11,870
Is my own mother hitting me, you punk?

533
00:37:12,170 --> 00:37:14,350
Then maybe I should just die.

534
00:37:14,390 --> 00:37:15,690
Get away from me, you punk.

535
00:37:15,730 --> 00:37:16,730
You bastard.

536
00:37:19,130 --> 00:37:20,730
My meal ticket, this...

537
00:37:21,050 --> 00:37:22,850
Do you know how expensive this is, punk?

538
00:37:22,890 --> 00:37:23,890
You damn bastard.

539
00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:25,670
Get lost, you bastard.

540
00:37:26,650 --> 00:37:27,650
Hey, let's go.

541
00:37:30,910 --> 00:37:32,710
Hey, what's this?

542
00:37:33,530 --> 00:37:34,970
What's this?

543
00:37:35,270 --> 00:37:36,550
Get away.

544
00:37:36,590 --> 00:37:37,590
Get away.

545
00:37:38,870 --> 00:37:39,870
You can't get away.

546
00:37:41,050 --> 00:37:42,050
Help me.

547
00:37:45,050 --> 00:37:46,050
I can't get away.

548
00:37:46,670 --> 00:37:47,670
I can't get away.

549
00:37:50,570 --> 00:37:51,570
Oh, you little punk.

550
00:37:57,270 --> 00:37:58,270
Hey.

551
00:38:01,630 --> 00:38:02,630
Ah, this kid.

552
00:38:11,610 --> 00:38:12,310
Are you hurt?

553
00:38:12,650 --> 00:38:13,650
Are you okay?

554
00:38:14,790 --> 00:38:15,990
Look here.

555
00:38:16,510 --> 00:38:17,510
What did I tell you?

556
00:38:17,930 --> 00:38:19,280
I told you not to come out.

557
00:38:20,650 --> 00:38:24,330
My son said he missed his mother, so I brought him.

558
00:38:24,950 --> 00:38:26,210
I missed you too.

559
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:35,640
When the full moon comes, I'll ask
my boss for a day off and come see you.

560
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:39,460
The day of the great full moon is our Sunnam's birthday, right?

561
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:40,500
Right?

562
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:46,720
I'll bring our Sunnam's favorite rice cakes and come find you.

563
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:50,140
You share them with your friends.

564
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:52,200
Okay?

565
00:38:53,020 --> 00:38:54,020
No.

566
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:55,310
You don't have to come.

567
00:38:55,740 --> 00:38:58,820
I know you're busy making money, Mother.

568
00:39:07,750 --> 00:39:13,470
As long as my Sunnam isn't sick, I have nothing to worry about.

569
00:39:14,410 --> 00:39:16,230
Save your money quickly.

570
00:39:16,430 --> 00:39:17,680
We have to buy our house.

571
00:39:18,010 --> 00:39:21,530
Then Mother and Sunnam can live together, right?

572
00:39:41,180 --> 00:39:43,640
Now, you should go.

573
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:45,710
I have to get back to work.

574
00:39:49,940 --> 00:39:53,720
Here, buy something to eat with your friends.

575
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:54,100
No.

576
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:55,240
I don't want it.

577
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:59,180
You save your money, and I'll save
mine, so we can buy our house quickly.

578
00:39:59,860 --> 00:40:01,110
Stop talking and take it.

579
00:40:04,060 --> 00:40:04,740
Sunnam.

580
00:40:04,780 --> 00:40:05,780
Sunnam.

581
00:40:36,180 --> 00:40:37,180
Oh,

582
00:40:42,170 --> 00:40:43,170
Are you hurt?

583
00:40:43,470 --> 00:40:44,470
Are you okay?

584
00:40:44,690 --> 00:40:45,690
Are you hurt?

585
00:40:46,470 --> 00:40:47,470
The hat, the hat.

586
00:40:48,750 --> 00:40:49,730
You damn punk.

587
00:40:49,770 --> 00:40:50,820
Your head is so hard.

588
00:40:51,090 --> 00:40:52,390
A few hits won't hurt you.

589
00:40:53,190 --> 00:40:55,230
I won't let that guy get away.

590
00:40:55,470 --> 00:40:56,670
I'll teach him a lesson.

591
00:40:57,070 --> 00:41:01,050
Let's catch him when he's walking at
night, cover him with a mat, and beat him up.

592
00:41:01,090 --> 00:41:03,150
Put dog poop in his hat, just one step away...

593
00:41:03,190 --> 00:41:04,190
That's a good one.

594
00:41:04,730 --> 00:41:06,570
You idiot, what's that?

595
00:41:07,330 --> 00:41:09,330
You should smear poop all over his face.

596
00:41:11,150 --> 00:41:12,270
Don't do anything.

597
00:41:15,430 --> 00:41:20,410
If my mother gets beaten up again
because of that, it'll be a big problem.

598
00:41:22,490 --> 00:41:24,170
You bastard.

599
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:45,500
You bastard.

600
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:48,140
What did you beggars eat today?

601
00:41:48,260 --> 00:41:49,410
You're in for it today.

602
00:41:49,580 --> 00:41:52,020
What do we do? The Boss is bleeding from his head.

603
00:41:52,060 --> 00:41:53,310
You're dead, you bastard.

604
00:41:53,580 --> 00:41:54,840
This bastard.

605
00:41:55,580 --> 00:41:57,120
You're going to bleed today.

606
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:01,540
What's going on?

607
00:42:02,420 --> 00:42:03,360
Let go, you bastard.

608
00:42:03,460 --> 00:42:04,460
Let go.

609
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:05,880
You bastard.

610
00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:07,360
You bastard.

611
00:42:12,260 --> 00:42:14,020
What do we do? The Boss is being taken away.

612
00:42:14,060 --> 00:42:16,360
Hey, what happens if the Boss gets taken away?

613
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:20,520
Toe.

614
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:24,040
Punishment meal.

615
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:30,120
Boss, just like you said, I've brought
it with a lot of sand and sawdust.

616
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:35,360
This is a true punishment meal.

617
00:42:35,860 --> 00:42:38,940
From now on, no complaints. Gulp it down in one go.

618
00:42:40,740 --> 00:42:43,760
Do I have to wring your damn neck for you to eat it?

619
00:42:45,380 --> 00:42:49,440
Swallow it in one gulp so the sound
can be heard all the way to the village.

620
00:42:58,460 --> 00:43:00,110
Aren't you going to eat properly?

621
00:43:07,300 --> 00:43:08,950
Why is Toe becoming the new boss?

622
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:16,140
He's the strongest, after all.

623
00:43:17,860 --> 00:43:19,860
Next, Rat Droppings.

624
00:43:21,380 --> 00:43:22,940
Hey, Mackerel Pike.

625
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:24,340
You keep eating.

626
00:43:29,080 --> 00:43:30,600
You idiot.

627
00:43:31,060 --> 00:43:34,160
When was the last time you managed to beg for a grain of rice?

628
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:37,230
Even a mouse is better at begging than you.

629
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:38,600
Hey, Frog.

630
00:43:38,780 --> 00:43:39,980
Go get the punishment meal.

631
00:43:40,020 --> 00:43:41,840
Put a lot of sand in it and give it to him.

632
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:43,180
And you call that begging?

633
00:43:44,780 --> 00:43:45,860
You useless fool.

634
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:49,130
You're worse at begging than a mouse.

635
00:43:51,220 --> 00:43:53,070
Is there a bigger idiot among idiots?

636
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:54,550
Get beaten to a pulp.

637
00:44:11,020 --> 00:44:12,020
Damn it.

638
00:44:15,560 --> 00:44:17,880
Hey, you useless bastards, what are you doing?

639
00:44:18,540 --> 00:44:20,190
Why aren't you out there begging?

640
00:44:20,300 --> 00:44:21,850
Do you want to starve to death?

641
00:45:01,250 --> 00:45:03,170
Why are there so many coins?

642
00:45:03,710 --> 00:45:04,710
Don't touch it.

643
00:45:05,270 --> 00:45:06,270
It's all mine.

644
00:45:09,270 --> 00:45:10,720
I'd rather die with you guys.

645
00:45:11,390 --> 00:45:12,390
Show me.

646
00:45:12,810 --> 00:45:13,650
Show me.

647
00:45:13,690 --> 00:45:13,890
Show me.

648
00:45:14,530 --> 00:45:15,330
Hey, hey.

649
00:45:15,570 --> 00:45:16,570
Show me.

650
00:45:27,620 --> 00:45:28,620
What is it?

651
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:29,460
Let me see this.

652
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:30,480
No.

653
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:31,880
Not this.

654
00:45:32,380 --> 00:45:33,460
This is my mother's.

655
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:34,680
Absolutely not.

656
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:37,560
We are brothers.

657
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:40,280
We beg together and share everything equally.

658
00:45:41,060 --> 00:45:44,560
Watch carefully what happens to a guy who tries to survive on his own.

659
00:45:54,980 --> 00:45:55,980
Rat Droppings.

660
00:45:56,900 --> 00:45:57,900
Rat Droppings.

661
00:45:59,460 --> 00:46:00,860
Rat Droppings, are you okay?

662
00:46:15,750 --> 00:46:16,390
Rat Droppings.

663
00:46:16,430 --> 00:46:17,530
Parrot, say something.

664
00:46:17,810 --> 00:46:19,190
I think Rat Droppings is sleeping.

665
00:46:19,230 --> 00:46:20,090
He's not sleeping.

666
00:46:20,150 --> 00:46:20,770
Hurry up and talk to him.

667
00:46:20,890 --> 00:46:21,610
Rat Droppings, Parrot.

668
00:46:21,690 --> 00:46:22,790
Rat Droppings, Parrot.

669
00:47:08,360 --> 00:47:09,440
Stay right there.

670
00:47:26,030 --> 00:47:27,330
Hey, did a guardian come?

671
00:47:27,890 --> 00:47:28,890
No.

672
00:48:13,960 --> 00:48:16,160
I'm not a real beggar.

673
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:21,110
I'm just pretending to be a beggar until I
save enough money to buy our house back.

674
00:48:21,980 --> 00:48:26,340
My mother and I were kicked out of our
house because of a debt my father left.

675
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:32,380
Since I'm a big kid, no one would take my mother in.

676
00:48:33,060 --> 00:48:35,060
So I came to the beggar's den on my own.

677
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:40,020
After ten nights, I go to see my mother once.

678
00:48:41,160 --> 00:48:43,380
No matter how much I miss her, I have to endure it.

679
00:48:43,420 --> 00:48:45,940
My mother is really pretty, right?

680
00:48:46,920 --> 00:48:49,480
Do any of you have a mother as pretty as mine?

681
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:51,360
You don't, right?

682
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:05,200
Sunnam!

683
00:50:14,550 --> 00:50:15,550
Sunnam!

684
00:50:15,910 --> 00:50:16,910
Sunnam!

685
00:50:17,210 --> 00:50:18,210
What's this?

686
00:50:20,010 --> 00:50:21,010
Sunnam!

687
00:50:21,230 --> 00:50:22,990
Why are you like this?

688
00:50:23,110 --> 00:50:24,110
Sunnam!

689
00:50:24,790 --> 00:50:25,790
Sunnam!

690
00:50:26,490 --> 00:50:27,410
Sunnam!

691
00:50:27,450 --> 00:50:28,550
Why are you like this?

692
00:50:29,030 --> 00:50:30,030
Sunnam!

693
00:50:31,330 --> 00:50:32,330
Sunnam!

694
00:50:32,870 --> 00:50:34,070
Why are you like this?

695
00:50:34,310 --> 00:50:34,770
Sunnam!

696
00:50:35,230 --> 00:50:36,230
Sunnam!

697
00:50:37,950 --> 00:50:39,210
Why are you like this?

698
00:51:06,990 --> 00:51:07,990
Sunnam!

699
00:51:13,070 --> 00:51:14,390
Rat Droppings is dead.

700
00:51:15,870 --> 00:51:17,230
You killed him!

701
00:51:18,950 --> 00:51:20,370
Are you challenging me now?

702
00:51:20,830 --> 00:51:21,830
Yes.

703
00:51:21,990 --> 00:51:22,610
With fists?

704
00:51:22,690 --> 00:51:23,690
Or with guts?

705
00:51:24,190 --> 00:51:25,190
Either one.

706
00:51:25,830 --> 00:51:26,830
Fine.

707
00:51:27,770 --> 00:51:29,820
Tomorrow morning, we play the train game.

708
00:51:36,470 --> 00:51:38,150
Anchovy is truly insane.

709
00:51:38,830 --> 00:51:42,658
Toe is so tough, he'll lie
there until the train's about to

710
00:51:42,678 --> 00:51:46,270
hit his forehead. How can
you possibly win against that?

711
00:51:46,850 --> 00:51:48,470
What if he gets killed?

712
00:51:49,530 --> 00:51:51,130
He'll end up like Rat Droppings.

713
00:51:51,230 --> 00:51:52,830
You think Toe will let it slide?

714
00:51:54,020 --> 00:51:54,450
Hey!

715
00:51:54,730 --> 00:51:55,730
Hurry up!

716
00:52:01,100 --> 00:52:03,100
Why are you suddenly so jumpy?

717
00:52:07,260 --> 00:52:08,340
It's the train!

718
00:52:08,740 --> 00:52:09,740
The train is coming!

719
00:52:40,140 --> 00:52:42,100
Hey, you punk!

720
00:52:42,220 --> 00:52:43,220
Get up!

721
00:52:43,380 --> 00:52:44,380
Hey, you punk!

722
00:52:49,120 --> 00:52:50,200
Why...

723
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:07,400
What are girls to you, punk?

724
00:53:09,300 --> 00:53:10,380
Thanks.

725
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:12,760
Mother!

726
00:53:15,740 --> 00:53:16,820
M-Z!

727
00:53:19,100 --> 00:53:20,100
Boss!

728
00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:22,120
Where are you going again?

729
00:53:24,560 --> 00:53:25,560
M-Z
