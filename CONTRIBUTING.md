This project uses a proprietary method called **PTT (Precise Translation Timing)**.  
All contributions must respect the following principles:

- Subtitles must align **word-for-word** with spoken dialogue
- Timing should reflect natural speech rhythm, not scene changes
- Do not modify or replicate the underlying PTT workflow or logic

The PTT system is copyrighted and not open source.
